        "   - Step 1: Description – What happened? Describe the situation factually and clearly.\n",
        "   - Step 2: Feelings – What were you thinking and feeling? Reflect on emotions and their influence.\n",
        "   - Step 3: Evaluation – What was good or bad about the experience? Assess outcomes.\n",
        "   - Step 4: Analysis – Why did things happen as they did? Explore causes and perspectives.\n",
        "   - Step 5: Conclusion – What else could you have done? Identify lessons and alternate choices.\n",
