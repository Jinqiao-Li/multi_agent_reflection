0,First  I prepared my workstation to be able to work on the task in a concentrated way.     Then I read through the case study several times and spontaneously started to answer the questions.     I approached the task neutrally and openly and felt quite comfortable.     After initially working on the task without learning content  I read through the tips and was able to add more reproduction and give the solution a structure based on background knowledge.     The tips helped me a lot to improve my solution.     I am satisfied with my performance.     However  I am aware that it is not 100% complete.     Unfortunately  however  I do not know what is still missing or what can be improved.     After all  it is a good exercise and does not have to be perfect.,"[1, 1, 1, 1]"
1,Very motivated  because I find class events and class dynamics very important for good and effective learning.     It is interesting to read about the current research on the topic and compare it with my own experiences+observations.     I felt the case study was very stilted and not clear to follow  otherwise I would have felt very well prepared.     I think so  yes.     Going through the lessons mentally.     Yes  very focused.     S.o     Good.     Enriched.     I'll stick with my solution.     The reflection is enjoyable because it illustrates to me how I handled the issue of class management and dealing with disruptions.     Positive.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
2,Quite motivated  class management and dealing with disruptions are one of the most important issues in my eyes.     Very  see above     As for the materials  pretty good  also with the further literature etc.     As for my prior knowledge  not so good ...hopefully!     Putting myself in the situation  thinking of how I would deal with it. yes.     Quite well.     With everything regarding written assignments etc. pretty good  independent learning on StudOn is harder for me without synchronous lectures.     A lot better than before     My focus was possibly a bit too much on the theoretical basics and not enough on the practical implementation ...reflected.     Good  has helped me in any case very much,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
3,With regard to my upcoming pedagogical-didactic internship  I wanted to learn something about the topic and was therefore motivated and had a keen interest in it.     By reading the script I felt well prepared for the question  whereby here especially the security helped to be able to look up at any time.     The task itself was clearly understandable for me.     While reading the script I was not particularly concentrated  as I consider most of the content to be pure common sense.     With the assignment  on the other hand  I developed more and more interest during the writing process.     I felt myself put in the situation and wanted to find the best possible solution for myself in order to be prepared for later situations in my daily work.     I enjoyed imagining how the conflicts would be successfully managed and how a positive classroom climate would be created.     Working out on Studon left me a little confused at times and I hope I have now interpreted the tasks correctly.     In the script there was something about three courses of action for the example meant there and in the exercise unit there is another case study.     I did not learn as much as I had hoped  because some things were already there (subconsciously).     I would have liked a little more new knowledge.     More concrete examples of action that one does not know from one's own teaching as a student would have been enriching.     I understood the approaches from the script and also stored them in my memory in their main features.     I am satisfied with my development of the case study.     There I could directly apply what I had learned  especially with regard to the situation analysis.,"[1, 1, 1, 1]"
4,Before working on the task  I felt a little uncertain  but at least generally well prepared  since I had already looked at and worked through the lecture slides set to music  the scripts from the basic seminar and the lecture  and had also read through the literature given.     This was my first approach: Gathering information and pre-informing as best I could on the subject matter or providing an understanding and overview.     The second step was then an understanding of the work assignment and what form this elaboration should take.     This one caused me some problems (see reflection on the situation during editing).     I found the learning content very informative and easy to understand and apply in its abstract outlines.     However  they seemed to me difficult to summarize in their abundance without possibly neglecting important points.     This was also an obstacle for me in working on the written assignment.     However  the biggest obstacle for me was the ignorance or openness to the form  scope and structure that the processing of this task should have.     Is it more of an examination task character or does it go more in the direction of a homework from the processing.     This is also reflected in my elaboration  which I have revised several times in terms of structure  without finding a solution that would have fully convinced me.     Even the editing tips did not help me here.     An example of what represents the most important key points for the analysis of a case study or how something like this can be structured  I could unfortunately not really figure out and this will be an important task for me for the future and further studies.     I am very satisfied with my learning result with this learning unit.     I have discovered some new things for later practice and  in particular  with the action matrix according to Becker  I have become acquainted with a good practical tool for conflict and disturbance analysis.     The versatile strategies  possibilities of consideration and possibilities of action for class management were very memorable and feel like a good first preparation for later practice.     I am both satisfied and dissatisfied with the outcome of my written assignment.     From my point of view  I addressed all points of the assignment and was able to draw some conclusions and possible courses of action from the processing of the case study that were informative for me.     At the same time  however  a more structured  deeper analysis seems possible to me  for which  however  the resources or the insights remained closed to me in the present elaboration.,"[1, 1, 1, 1]"
5,I set myself up for instruction on how to manage and situations problems and classroom disruptions as a future teacher.     It only became clear to me during this process how relevant     it is not only to intervene in retrospect  but also to define clear rules in advance in order to enable all students as well as the teacher himself to teach and learn in a pleasant classroom climate.     Finally  I must say that dealing with the issue of disruptions in the classroom has shown me that there is no such thing as a disruption-free classroom.     These must be mastered as a teacher only situationally  often spontaneously and correctly  in order to grant the class climate for all.     This thought has enriched me very much with regard to my hopefully future practice as a teacher.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
6,Looking back  I can say that the task was very interesting and exciting to work on.     Previously  I had worked through both the lecture and the basic seminar with the relevant texts and summarized them clearly.     With the task itself  it came at the beginning to first start difficulties  because I did not know how I should start best  gradually  with intensive occupation of the topic  the analysis went then actually quite well from the hand.     Especially the combination of the contents of the lecture and the basic seminar was extremely helpful in working on both sub-tasks!     In the second part of the task  however  I struggled a bit more  because I did not know which approach I should best take for such a  yet complex  situation  the principles of efficient class management according to Kounin did not seem efficient enough to me.     I also found dispute resolution  as already written above  rather useful for a conflict between students* themselves.     After I decided to use the action matrix  I still had some doubts  but I hope that this approach is reasonably appropriate after all.     However  what I would add in addition would be the earlier involvement of the class itself.     Since I believe that this can lead to a better understanding of both sides.     I hope the assignment was handled sufficiently and to your satisfaction.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
7,I approached the task with motivation  as it is something practical due to the case study.     I find it very interesting  as you will certainly experience this frequently later in your own teaching and have now already dealt with how you should possibly deal with classroom disturbances.     In the beginning  unfortunately  not so good  because unfortunately there were no lectures where the content of the slides was explained to you again in other words.     With the help of the tips I knew what and how to work on the task.     The practical reference with the case study  because you could think yourself so well in a perhaps later in professional life real situation and could think for yourself how you would deal with it or should deal with it.     Yes  but only when I kept taking breaks  since reading and understanding the literature took a lot of time and concentration.     With the assistance given  good;     without them  however  it would not have been entirely clear to me how I could/should approach the task.     Online lectures help me understand the subject matter better than completely independent learning.     Better than before  since this course was the first time I really dealt with this topic.     I think that my solution is good  but definitely expandable.     Similar to my solution.     I did my best and I hope that I understood and worked on the task correctly,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
8,Motivated by my standards  because I find the topic interesting and it has a practical relevance  which I often miss in other subjects of study Very  because disturbances will later be part of everyday life and the confident handling of them is unavoidable.     I find the online VL + slides were sufficient to be able to work on the task well.     I hope so.     So from my subjective point of view a clear yes.     To put yourself in the position of a teacher who has just had a wet sponge thrown in his face.     It is rather untypical - Yes  no distractions whatsoever and my attempted solution almost wrote itself -     I thought about it  tried to put myself in the situation and then started quite quickly with the processing.     After about halfway through  I did look at the clue to check if it was going in the right direction.     Overall I think it fits  but I'm a little unsure if my reflections are detailed enough since I'm not really a reflection expert yet.     You never stop learning...     My verdict: I understood the content of the VL and can remember it  without further re-reading.     As in one of the previous reflections  still as good.     Nothing has changed in my opinion here.     I think I have recognized important points and managed to get a decent result.     I am still very unpracticed in reflections  so I would say that there is still room for improvement here.     Overall as a rock solid overall result.,"[1, 1, 1, 1]"
9,I found the task very interesting and well chosen.     I took a block seminar with Ms. Truckenbrodt this semester on appreciative communication and dealing with difficult parents and students.     From there  I was able to quickly find my way into the topic.     I was just a little confused at first by the different submission forms and wasn't sure if I should submit one document or five now  but I was able to figure that out.     It was relatively difficult for me to read through the lecture slides  I took several breaks and then had to look at unclear content in the lecture recording again.     However  I generally find it quite difficult to work through content independently.     I have a hard time concentrating on video recordings and often digress when reading pdfs and have to start over.     Therefore  I need a lot of breaks.     The written task didn't seem particularly difficult to me now  I was able to write it quite quickly.     However  I am not quite sure if I completed the task as it was intended.     I think that I was already forced by the task to deal with the subject contents more intensively than I usually do.     Besides  the topic interested me.     Therefore  I already think that I have taken a lot with me here.     I hope that I have done the task well and properly in itself.     But I have a generally positive feeling.,"[1, 1, 1, 1]"
10,I found the topic most exciting so far in school pedagogy and was motivated to work on the topic.     Even after I worked on the lecture  the topic still interested me a lot  because it was more practice-oriented than the other lectures  which I sometimes already find very exhausting.     However  I was overwhelmed with the format of editing at the beginning.     I didn't understand the system with the tips at first and thought 1-5 are different tasks.     Then also did not understand the meaning at first.     Besides  I think it should be indicated the scope of the task.     (how many pages you should write).     But otherwise I think it's a great way to work on lectures and would have found such assignments good in the other lectures to internalize the material.     The editing went quite well and I could work on it well concentrated for a few hours.     I did not know exactly how big the scope should be.     But otherwise I get along well with the tasks.     I found this lecture most helpful until now.     Otherwise  with the other lectures  I can rarely make direct reference to practice and teaching.     That these are very theoretical and I find that a pity  because I do not have the feeling with the didactics to be well prepared for my professional life.     I could learn a lot from the topic of class management in dealing with disturbances.,"[1, 1, 1, 1]"
11,Before the work I picked out and downloaded the appropriate set of slides.     The assignment was easy for me to understand and I found my way around StudOn very quickly  as we have had many online semesters now.     I also read through the case study more than once and always had it as an open tab as well as the slides and the Word document to access all the information as quickly as possible.     During the work I switched between tabs to be able to link the information gained from the lecture well with the case study.     I was very focused and did not get distracted.,"[1, 1, 1, 0]"
12,I did not understand the question at first.     After my inquiry was answered very competently by Mrs. Weigand  the processing was not difficult for me  because the literature and already self-made experiences describe and let analyze the case very detailed.     A more concrete question would have been very helpful to me to possibly intensify learning phases such as teaching behavior  preparation or follow-up or prevention of a conflict to describe or present.,"[0, 0, 1, 1]"
13,I particularly Motivated but also not averse.     I find the subject matter interesting and very practice-oriented to the later profession.     I felt well prepared .     The assignment to the case study was very clear however were the further.     Tasks were not very clear.     The practicality of the assignment .     Yes I was concentrated .     I got along well .     I found the processing of the written task good  the preparation of the reflection was not clearly explained.     My state of competence has improved as a result of the task.     I judge the solution of the case study as successful.     I judge my reflection as quite detailed.     I think I have understood the topic sufficiently,"[1, 1, 1, 0]"
14,Reflecting  it can be said that I approached the task with motivation  since the topic interests me and can represent an important and also difficult problem in my later profession.     Through the lecture slides I already had a good basis and prior knowledge.     During the processing I was always concentrated and had fun analyzing the case study.     This served as a good exercise to apply and use my knowledge.     For some slides I was missing some more input  so I worked with the tips and additionally looked at some texts of the recommended literature  which illustrated some points even more.     After working on the task and the questions I gained in new ideas and knowledge.     In some places it was still a little difficult for me     to include examples     to include     and especially the approach according to Oscher seems to me still a bit too abstractly formulated     All in all  however  I worked on the learning unit with great interest and tried to understand the most important points in a meaningful order.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
15,For the reflection of my work steps it is to be mentioned that I looked at the lecture slides and the literature mentioned in preparation and could dedicate myself thus well informed to the example.     The topic is very interesting for me  because I can well imagine a situation as described in the example.     If I had gone to class with the little knowledge I had before working on this topic  I would have been very helpless in the situation mentioned.     In this respect  dealing with the content has helped me in every way.     During the processing  my concentration was well present  which is why I was able to process the task in a well-structured manner.     Among other things  I oriented myself to the help on StudOn  as this made the common thread clearer to me.     Overall  I find working independently with available literature good  but motivating myself is usually a challenge.     After working on the assignment  I now feel better prepared to face conflicts especially in a class  or to act preventively in advance.     In my opinion  I succeeded well in working out the task and I was also able to reflect in a good way.     Overall  I consider the learning unit to have been successfully worked on.,"[0, 0, 1, 1]"
16,I approached the task very motivated  because the topic in general interests me very much  because disturbances and conflicts are unavoidable and of course as a teacher I would like to act correctly in such situations and keep them as low as possible through prevention.     Moreover  this topic has a very great practical relevance which only motivates me even more.     To prepare for the task  I went through the set of slides on this topic again and looked at which slides I could use for answering with regard to the question.     This gave me a rough overview and then I was able to start working on it relatively quickly.     I had a hard time with the case study  because it was very general and a lot of information was missing  which I more or less thought of or interpreted myself afterwards.     That's why I was then also somewhat unsettled  because I did not know exactly whether that was the intention or not.     Moreover  I also didn't know exactly how deep I should go into the case study or simply add it as an example for explanation.     During the processing I also read some suggested texts  which I liked very much because they explained many terms and methods again and showed and clarified them with practical examples.     With the entire task I get along relatively well  I like it quite well that I can make myself more or less a schedule as I work on the topic and can then also go through it at my pace.     I have the feeling that I know the subject area very well because I have read a lot in the literature and my interest is also very high.     I think my solution to the written assignment is good although I had a hard time especially with the case study and I also tried to work on it as far as possible without assistance.     In addition  the horizon of expectations is unclear to me to what extent we should go into depth in this processing.,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
17,I found the framework of the assignment appropriate and reasonable.     Especially a situation like the one in the case study is practice-oriented and can be encountered by every teacher in his or her career.     Often one has to react spontaneously to predictable situations in everyday school life.     I solved the task without further hints  because after an extensive brainstorming many ideas came to my mind to solve the elaboration.     In order to structure the text  I followed the contents of the lecture and the basic seminar.     I tried to keep the focus on the case study  as this seemed to me to be the most important.     I have only added definitions of individual technical terms.     On the whole  I am satisfied with the processing of the assignment.     However  I was irritated by the fact that a reflection was not mentioned in the assignment; I was only made aware of this in the seminar.,"[1, 1, 1, 1]"
18,Before the work phase  I approached the task with motivation and made a plan of what materials I would need to answer the questions.     What interested me most in the topic was the prevention of disorder (here especially Kounin's perspective in the ecological approach)  but also what participatory possibilities there are for students (e.g. the class council).     The first task was clearly and unambiguously formulated  but with the second I was unsure whether a short-term (What do I do shortly after the wet blackboard sponge lands in my face?) or a long-term reaction was called for.     For the most part  the processing phase was concentrated  the assistance was helpful  and I basically got along quite well with both tasks.     In general  it was an interesting different experience to work with the assignments in the more open-ended format and in my opinion  the motivation to engage with the literature and work through it was higher.  I think my skill level has     improved     improved           mainly because of the relatively practical application situation  which indirectly tries to show you different problem areas to pay attention to in the teaching profession (e.g. pay attention to students' needs)     Overall  I am satisfied with my solution to the written assignment and would describe my learning progress in this area as profitable.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
19,[     Well  I knew that the assignment was a necessary requirement for writing the exam.     So my motivation was solely to complete it in order to be admitted to the exam.     How to deal with disturbances I find interesting  but apart from the very practical text by Lohmann and some passages by Becker  I did not have the impression that the literature would have helped me in a real conflict situation  since the suggestions for action described in it were  in my opinion are formulated too little concretely and too abstractly  or also simply not realizable  since for it probably not at all sufficient time would be available in instruction and I can well imagine that some of the recommendations for action  in particular from young and older Sus would not be taken seriously  because they are simply too lax...     ][In editing  the only thing that was actually fun was reading the Lohmann text.     I found this one the most practical  since it dispenses with useless theoretical and scientific generalizations and formalities and is comparatively direct and concrete in its analysis of disorders as well as possible interventions.     Overall  I got along well using the references in processing the work assignment  however  it lowered my motivation and concentration to repeatedly search in several  mostly very theoretical and general texts for the few usable passages for the practical solution of the conflict situation.     I found the work instructions  without having read the literature beforehand  to be much too vague.     Likewise the case study  since it contains too few concrete clues to possible mistakes of the teacher or disturbing motives of the students and thus many approaches to the solution must aim strongly into the speculative.  Without having read all the processing notes  I would not have known what was required of me in writing the assignment and reflection.     Since I had no time pressure to complete the lecture slides on a weekly basis  I was able to use the time for other courses  which allowed me to manage my time more flexibly.     However  without live lectures  I also had no real motivation to read  summarize  or learn from the lecture notes on my own on a regular basis.[I     still don't feel like I am really competent in the field after the unit.     While I can imagine having a basic tool and some guidance for practice at hand after working through the Lohmann text and Beck's excerpt in detail  I do not believe that one can actually speak of acquired competence after reading the texts without having tried out the interventions described in them in practice.     I probably could have included more dialogic interventions in my solution.     However  I saw no real reason to do so  based on the less than informative case study.     Depending on the grade level  level of insight  and basic attitude of the class  more or less time could also be spent on jointly creating rules of behavior in the classroom and lessons.     Honestly  I am a bit annoyed by all the meta-questions  which makes it difficult for me to reflect neutrally on my reflection.     Really haven't gotten much out of the unit so far.     However  I plan to take a closer look at the material on this once the exams are over and I can give the topic another chance in peace afterwards.,"[1, 1, 1, 1]"
20,Through the different texts  the lecture slides and lecture videos I had a very good overview of the topic to be worked on.     Above all by means of different case studies this became plausible and I could grasp the topic understandably.     Thus  I felt well prepared for the task.     After reading and asking several times  the task was clear and understandable.     The written assignment on the topic was not really difficult for me  because I was able to put myself in the teacher's shoes of the case study well  and thus I was able to analyze and reflect on the teacher's behavior and mistakes well.     I was also able to take the student perspective well and thus I enjoyed analyzing both sides.     Due to the fact that we had enough time to solve the task  I was able to divide my working time and work in a concentrated way each time.     The independent learning is in principle well doable  only it lacks sometimes fluent and immediate communication  because during the processing some questions had accumulated  which I would have liked to discuss more intensively.     I think that it is important and can be significant to make a reflection in order to be aware of what one has learned or perhaps not yet learned.     I was able to follow the slides and material very well.     I think I did well on the written assignment and I used the prevention measures and intervention measures correctly and I am now aware of them.     The reflection gave me a good overview of where there may still be difficulties and in which areas I am fit.,"[0, 1, 1, 1]"
21,To prepare for the written assignment  I first read through the slides from the lecture on the topic of class management and dealing with disruptions in order to acquire some initial basic knowledge.  I got along relatively well with the assignment  whereby the tips were a good help if questions arose for the processing.     The given literature also provided some interesting information  with Becker's action matrix being particularly helpful in processing.     I was particularly interested in finding out more about the proper way to deal with disruptive classes while learning more about typical mistakes and disruptions made by teachers.     In conclusion  I can say that I have now been able to acquire more theoretical knowledge about dealing with disruptions and I hope that I will be able to put this into practice in the upcoming internships.,"[0, 0, 1, 1]"
22,Relatively motivated  as I am glad about the saved learning effort.     Subject matter in itself does not interest me now more or less than other topics in school pedagogy.     I felt well prepared  but I am dissatisfied with my result because I hardly incorporated anything from the presentation  but mainly my own experiences.     I understood the task.     I especially enjoyed simply thinking about a solution approach.     Yes  I was focused.     As already written  I would have liked a more concrete case.     Overall I did well  only I don't quite understand the meaning of this reflection.  I see my solution as not so good  but my competence level relatively high.     The     reflection I find somehow strange.     I am very satisfied with the learning unit.,"[1, 1, 1, 1]"
23,I took the slides  worked through them  read through the corresponding texts in the Studon folder and worked on the assignments.     Due to time constraints  I worked on the assignments in more or less detail.     I found the described situation a good example to reflect on one's own actions.     It bothered me that there were so many folders where you could have uploaded the file.     Otherwise I got along relatively well.  The learning outcomes that you take away       are good for self-reflection.     Not only how one should act but also how exactly one could work on the contents.     I am not completely satisfied with my result  as it definitely could have been done more precisely.,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
24,I find the subject area very interesting because it can often be difficult to resolve conflicts.     Due to the fact that everyone approaches conflicts differently  you can also write a lot here accordingly.     At first  however  it was not clear to me how exactly to approach this assignment.     I then read through some tips on the website and oriented myself to these.     I started with the definition and then made pretty good progress.     I mainly stuck to the lecture slides  because I find them easier than long texts.     I got along well with the learning contents and I tried to explain them as well as I could.     I had some problems with the structure and was not sure how detailed these topics should be written out.     Another problem for me was the example.     You didn't get very much information about how the teacher dealt with the class  which meant you had to speculate more often and include many different aspects which might be problematic.     Nevertheless  I thought it was good that one could write relatively much on the subject.     I am satisfied with my result  because I dealt with the topic for a long time and I enjoyed being able to make a written connection between theory and practice.     This also helped me in memorizing the theoretical aspects and I think that now I am much more familiar with this topic.     I think the second workload will be a little easier for me now that I know roughly what to expect.,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
25,I felt relatively comfortable before working on the assignment.     I was well prepared in my opinion  because of the slides and the literature.     However  I did not completely understand how to work on the task and found the questions too open and unspecific.     The topic of class management and dealing with disruptions interests me a lot  which is why I was quite motivated  but quickly lost some of my motivation because I was unsure of how to complete the task.     I coped well with the task  especially because I felt I could analyze the case study well with the help of the slides and literature.     I would have liked to see more description of the teacher's behavior and classroom management in the case study  this would have made it easier for me to analyze the situation and design potential solutions.     I enjoyed analyzing the situation the most  I enjoyed making reflections less since they serve no purpose for me  but I realize they are probably helpful for the professors.     Also  I was very unsure how long and detailed my answers and reflections should be.     Therefore  I am a bit afraid that my work will be evaluated as unsatisfactory and I will not be admitted to the exam.     I assess my level of competence on the topic of class management and dealing with disruptions as good at the end of the learning unit.     In my opinion  such written assignments are more often better than exams because I dealt with the material more actively and I can remember it better later.     I judge my solution to the written assignment assufficient because I am still unsure how much exactly I should have written.,"[0, 1, 1, 1]"
26,Before working on it  I made a plan to keep track of it:     - What should be thematized/ addressed?     - How do I organize these topics? -     What needs to be explained and how?     -     Where do examples need to be cited for clarification?     During the editing it occurred to me that not all classes are the same and these also do not come by the same measures to a result concerning to the class management.     In addition  it should be noted that there is not only one measure to get a class quiet.     There are for this  not only in the class  many different approaches  like the dispute mediators in the break  or the meditation (for example before the beginning of the lesson).     To gain respect from the students  it takes more than just good teaching.     Rules and  if necessary  a fixed structure must be introduced so that the children can adjust to how the lessons are run.     After editing  I gained insight into the field of classroom management  but it is far too large to address here.     However  I have been able to learn some perspectives that will be useful in my future career or even in internships.     This example showed me that the topic of class management and dealing with disruptions was understood in theory  but can be challenging in practice.     For the upcoming school-based block practicum  I plan to look at this topic more closely in a class and contribute to change if necessary.  5,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
27,First of all I find this topic very interesting   because it is very important for the later work as a teacher and but also for the SuS.     I have watched the lecture  but hardly anything has stuck  because I prefer to consolidate what I have learned with tasks.     I especially enjoyed that it was not boring.     As already mentioned above  I prefer to work out what I have learned again with tasks for visualization.     That helps me to memorize everything better.     Through the learning module I have definitely improved my skills.     My solution is certainly not yet completely correct  if it is at all possible with such case studies.     However  I feel more confident with the subject matter.,"[0, 0, 1, 0]"
28,I was actually quite interested in this task after seeing the lecture  since disturbances are quite a big  central topic in the class.     I never had such problems with it in school and so I didn't witness how teachers would deal with such situations.     That's why I was curious to find out more about this topic.     I find it especially interesting how different teachers have different approaches to conflicts  and how as a teacher you also have to adapt to the class.     But since there are so many different ways to prevent and manage conflicts       I find it difficult to apply all of this to a case study that I don't know that much about either.     Now that I'm halfway through the assignment  I especially realize how many different points there are to cover in the first place.     It is fun to read the different texts and to get to know different approaches  even if I am sometimes overwhelmed and don't know exactly what I should write in my text and what I should rather leave out.     It is also exhausting to always have to go from text to text and back to Studon and not interrupt my flow of thoughts.     It is also difficult for me to decide how much I should write and whether I should possibly leave out a few points because it becomes too much.     Now that I am done with the text for the time being  I am much more aware of how many aspects there are to these conflicts.     Theoretically I have learned a lot  about preventive measures but also about concrete conflict solutions.     However  I cannot yet assess my practical competences in this situation  because I have never been in such a situation.     But I hope that when I find myself in such situations soon in my internships  I will be able to use my knowledge advantageously.     However  this topic specifically is so open and dependent on the children and the classes that it is very hard to cover every aspect in an essay  so I hope I put in as many aspects as possible.,"[0, 0, 1, 1]"
29,I considered this part of the module very important and exciting  which is why my motivation was very high.     Through my volunteer activities I already know such situations  but I cannot solve them in the classroom as I do in sports (e.g.  doing push-ups or running).     In terms of content  I was hoping for tips and solutions on how to get a handle on difficult classes.     Through my orientation internship  in which I was already allowed to teach complete classes on my own  I have already had my first experiences with challenging classes.     For me it was therefore very exciting to check whether my reactions and actions were correct.     I found it exciting during the processing that I actually witnessed a similar situation as a student.     During the processing I questioned my teacher's reaction and thought about how he could have reacted better.     In fact  I came to the conclusion that because of my classmates  the teacher could not have reacted better.     In principle  I enjoyed working on the assignments  even though I find the presentation unfortunate.     In general  I got along very well.     I find the independent elaboration of the learning contents on Studon pleasant and easy.     I feel well able to deal with disturbances in class.     The contents of the theoretical unit also confirm me in my reaction to previously experienced situations.     I consider my solution of the written task to be complete  as I have brought in a mixture of theoretical content and personal feeling.     I find the learning unit useful and well presented.     In my personal opinion  however  one can only gain confidence in dealing with disruptions in the classroom through experience and implementation of the theoretical content.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
30,Very motivated  as I felt I understood3 the topic.     It interests me because one is confronted with it more often in the teaching profession.     However  I think that you can not always act according to learned  but also act from the gut in a situation.     Nevertheless  the module can give you incentive to think about your actions in the future and whether you want to take the theory to heart or not.     Actually good.     Yep.     Since the same assignment keeps coming up  I'm a little confused as to whether it fits now.     Since I was sure from the beginning that I had done everything  the same worksheet in task 0 and 1 confused me a lot.     With this learning unit very well.     As I said  I hope good.     I find the constant asking how I got on with it a bit annoying  since I can't say for sure.     As I said  I think I got it.     But I don't know  of course  whether you see it exactly that way.     For this reason  I can only answer the question from my point of view and not from the point of view of the fact!!!     Is all right.     To see the Prof. times personally  would be really not bad.     It feels as if nothing comes from the Prof pages.     In itself I like editing alone  but as a freshman somewhat unsuitable  because you have to find your way with it first.     A better briefing would be already helpful there.     Basically I find the module good  but the questions give me again the feeling that the professor did not want to make much work and therefore designed everything asynchronously.     More targeted  varied questions would be great.     Also a better introduction to the whole lecture.     Also the accompanying seminar was not so well designed  as I was for example in the crash course which in retrospect was not really helpful  as we had to work on everything without even having seen the VL before and the time was also much too short.     Solutions were expected and I was not able to work on them to my satisfaction in that short amount of time because I could not read into the subject matter that quickly.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
31,Before working on the topic of class management and dealing with disturbances  I might have acted more quickly and impulsively by copying the behavior of my former teachers.     On the other hand  I have already thought a lot about it and thought about it before the topic.     Therefore it came also to no gigantic surprises.     At the beginning it was difficult for me the task.     Mainly for the reason that there were no concrete ideas about it  e.g.     How detailed should the analysis be.     How exactly should I present my reaction.     How detailed should the reflection be.     Etc.     However  when starting the task I noticed that you quickly get into a writing flow and I kept this result of writing flow.     Of course one could go for example with the analysis very much more into the detail  only that again rum I find in this context of the spontaneous reaction Not appropriate.     Furthermore  there had been certain organizational difficulties makes it a difference whether I use the assistance or not.     Wen I in the learning sequence simply click on continue get I the assistance automatically?     And is that then saved?     etc.     I still find this kind of exercise very good and I think that you should definitely keep it because you learn to act better so preventively.     Nevertheless  I can imagine that especially in this situation the difference between written elaboration and the real situation is very strong  in the written task I can plan and think about my actions neutrally  in the class much additional factors such as emotions play with a role.     As a result  it can quickly happen that one acts more impulsively than would be good  up to a certain point I think that is also ok.     I find it is however straight therefore important after one acted to consider  why and why one acted likewise.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
32,I am interested but not too euphoric about the task,"[0, 1, 0, 0]"
33,could come           that these disturbances took over     I tried to put myself in the situation and imagine what I would do then.     It quickly became clear to me that the most important thing would have been to approach the situation differently from the very beginning  rather than immediately entering the classroom as described.     Hence also part 1 with prevention.     I approached the task very motivated  because the topics of class management and disruptions are two of the probably most important topics in school pedagogy and especially as a student teacher without much practical experience  one then tries to grasp these very well theoretically.     Through the materials I also felt very well prepared to work on the case study.     I understood that I should first analyze the situation and then explain possible intervention measures (Part 2 Intervention).     I got along well with the learning content  the entire assignment as well as the written assignment  I especially enjoyed practicing criticism on the teacher of the case study  because you could see the mistakes very clearly especially in the initial phase and criticism in theory is much easier anyway than to perform it better in practice yourself.     I am satisfied with my learning result of this unit  I understood the theory of class management and dealing with disturbances well  thus I also judge my level of competence of the theory of these topics as good.     I am also satisfied with my solution of the written task  the only thing I am unsure of is whether there would have been better ways of solving the disruptions at the end of the case study (i.e. at the time of the sponge throwing)  as I was looking for the solutions mainly in the preventive measures and would have approached this situation differently from the beginning.     The reflection helped me to achieve a deeper understanding of my own learning progress in relation to these topics and to become aware of my level of competence.     In conclusion  I can say that I have understood this learning unit very deepened and very well as well as reflected and thus also acquired a secured knowledge of my understanding.,"[1, 1, 1, 1]"
34,I approached this task with motivation  as I was pleased to work out something myself  to read into the subject and also to reflect on it.     By uploading your results back to Stud On afterwards  I was even more motivated than if it had just been a voluntary submission.     Besides  I think the topic is very suitable  for such an assignment  because it is interesting  diverse and complex  where it is really about teaching events and what is coming up to you.     Through the slides  lectures and the basic seminar  I also felt well prepared.     With the help of the tips  I also knew more specifically how to approach and pay attention to the matter  since I had not worked on such an assignment before.     I also thought it was great that you could click through the task and look at as many tips as you wanted.     I enjoyed working on the assignment  especially because you deal more intensively with a topic that you will face in your future job and don't just learn information by heart  like for an exam.     I took notes  worked with the slides  read in the literature and did some research on the internet.     At the beginning I didn't know exactly how to classify the disorder at the end  however it helped me then to read into the literature that was deposited in the Stud on folder.     I would say that I learned a lot about this topic because it was studied and thought about in depth.     Conflicts and disturbances are part of everyday school life  which is why you cannot avoid this topic as a (prospective) teacher.     Overall  I am satisfied with my work.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
35,-In the beginning very motivated (case study!)  reflection: not motivated     ... -Topic: highly interesting and very important for practice -Preparation: alright -Task: case study clear  reflection unnecessarily complicated -Reflection unnecessarily complicated  thus fun factor greatly reduced.     -     After lecture and application: level of competence     good-We stand by our solution. -     Assessment of reflection: unnecessarily complicated,"[1, 1, 1, 0]"
36,I found it difficult to understand at first what exactly I have to perform and work on.     After reading carefully and with the slide set and additional materials  the task was then easy to understand.     I learned a lot about the topic of class management  because it is much easier to deal with it through a case study.,"[0, 0, 1, 0]"
37,I was not strongly motivated.     My motivation only stemmed from the fact that I had to do this assignment in order to be able to sit in on the exam.     Before editing  the term did not mean much to me  accordingly I had little interest in it.     I did not feel well prepared.     Without the help I would not have understood especially the first part question.     I enjoyed constructing a proposed solution for the case study.     Most of the time I was focused.     I had trouble figuring out exactly how to approach it and I still doubt now if I worked it correctly.     Due to the fact that we had no lectures this semester  it was hard for me to keep this course in mind  let alone develop an active interest in the content.     This also made the written assignments more difficult.     I understand some basic aspects  however  I cannot say that I have mastered the COMPLETE content.     I think my solution could be more detailed and there are definitely important aspects missing that I overlooked.     You can see that I had difficulties with the online lessons and that I had little motivation in general.     Nevertheless  I recognize an urge to understand the discussed material anyway 4+ or 3-;     So I am satisfied.,"[1, 1, 1, 0]"
38,At first I felt a little overwhelmed  since the theoretical from the lecture now has to be applied to a practical situation.     Subsequently  I went through the content again to get an overview of what exactly prevention and intervention measures are now.     For this  the first two tips also helped me a lot.     After I went through the content of the lecture again in great detail  I had understood everything and could also start writing relatively quickly.     When I thought I am once through  I noticed  however  that I had dealt mainly with the theoretical content and the case study still left out.     Therefore  I went through everything again to analyze the case study.     I am very satisfied with the general learning result  because I have dealt with the theoretical content for a relatively long time and now I think I have really understood everything.     I am also relatively satisfied with the result of my written assignment on the whole.,"[1, 1, 1, 1]"
39,I approached this task somewhat anxiously  since I did not know what to expect.     However  I was also confident that I could solve the task  since I had  in my opinion  dealt well with the subject matter.     When working on the task  I actually worked pretty freely  but I still looked at some information of the learning material more closely.     The task itself  analyzing the situation and describing my actions afterwards  was easier for me than my approach,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
40,I have to say that I overlooked writing a reflection  since it was not specifically stated in the assignment or was only briefly mentioned at the very beginning.     That is why I am not sure how to approach this one.  I have     proceeded as follows     :     First  I went over the lecture and tried to clear up any ambiguities.     I found the topic as well as the case study very interesting  as it is close to reality.     The points at Studon I found a little confusing  because I thought it was several tasks  eh I got behind the principle with the tips.     Actually  I wouldn't have wanted to take one in this case study because I found it quite plausible.     I learned thereby important information  which one can apply also in the future.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
41,Before the situation  I noticed that I didn't prepare properly because taking over this class happened at short notice  so I couldn't prepare for the new class for a longer period of time and get to know the students.     I also lacked structure because my goal is to teach the material that the children missed due to the illness of their teacher.     I approached the task with motivation because I wanted to teach the students the material during the absence of their previous classroom teacher  however  I did not address the issue of classroom management and dealing with disruptions.     It was also noticeable that the class was nice  friendly and attentive at the beginning.     I should have prepared better before the first lesson by asking the previous class teacher how the interaction between the teacher and the students is in this class and how the class community is among the students.     Thus  I would have already had a picture of the class.     I should have also looked at conflict cases and student problems in this class.     So that I would also have been more structure in the preparation  I should have asked the teacher if the children  understood the previous topics and where there were problems and if there was still need for talking about individual & previous topics before teaching the further material immediately.     That means I should have planned my lessons better.     At the first lesson  I should have also set rules so that I could work and learn together with the children.     Because this approach is community-building.     I also should have been suspicious of the students' friendliness at the beginning  maybe the students were faking their attention and participation.     The situation is bad at the moment because it shows classroom disruptions from students and the teacher.     Because the students have a lack of motivation to learn  which means that the children follow the lessons inattentively and are disinterested.     These classroom disruptions increase as the students show verbal disruptive behavior.     This behavior is evident by the children chattering and calling in during class.     This unacceptable behavior is also reinforced by the aggressive behavior of the students  because during class the children start shouting and at the same time are abusive and violent after a wet sponge is thrown at the teacher.     The teacher is also responsible for these classroom disturbances  because the teacher does not have a structure and does not pay attention to what is going on in the class  which means she does not act consistently and despite her intervention the situation does not change.     The types of conflicts also change during this time.     At the beginning there was an appearance that it was only a marginal conflict  because the students were only restless and this behavior affected the class only slightly  but after that it became the central conflict.     This behavior of the students is long-term and despite the intervention of the teacher  the situation does not change and this affects significantly.     For the situation to have improved  the teacher should have used different strategies of class management  such as Withitness  which means that the teacher should be aware of all the activities of the students  as well as Momentum  that the lessons are planned appropriately and take place without interruptions  and also Group Focus  that means that she focuses overall on the whole group.     When students exhibit behavior that is not tolerated  the teacher should have reinforced the desire of the appropriate behavior and intervened quickly when disruptions occur.     In order for the students to learn from the situation  the teacher should have used punishment when an unwanted behavior occurs.     The teacher should have also set rules at the beginning so that such a situation would not occur.     Thus  the children could have learned all together and peacefully or even attending programs like Faustlos or dispute mediation would have been good.     In order to manage these conflicts and it comes to the good intervention  the teacher should have prevented the conflicts early  if she had done that  it would not come to the central conflict.     She also should have been predictable  consistent and present to get the attention from the children.     Rules and sanctions should have been put by the teacher in advance and also the consequences with her behavior .     It would also have been best if the teacher would have guided the students to reflect  that is to show the students how their behavior affects the class and other classmates .,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
42,I think the topic of classroom management and dealing with disruptions is very important and interesting.     Regularly in a class conflicts can arise between students however between the teacher and student as well.     Therefore  it is important to show us future teachers methods and strategies to deal with such situations.     To work on the assignment I read through the lecture Class Management three times and took notes on it and read the text by Becker Handlungsmatrix zur Konfliktanalyse.     The assignment was even clearer to me because of the help that was available.     In the processing of the assignment  I really liked that as hours you should put yourself in the position of the teacher and the children  this brought us closer to practice.     I was concentrated in the work of the problem.     I think that I coped very well with both the assignment on class management and dealing with disturbances and with all the other assignments.     I learned many helpful and interesting methods that I can use in the future.     I think my level of competence is accordingly good.     I am concerned that I answered the question How would you respond? off-topic because my personal opinion forms a large part of the answer.     I think that the contents of my reflection are satisfactory.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
43,I did not feel very well prepared for the task.     However  it is probably because I have not dealt with the topic in detail  since it will not come up in the exam.     However  I actually find this very unfortunate  since the topic interests me very much in principle.     For me it was difficult to concentrate on the task  I miss the joint discussion and discussion in a real lecture.     The learning modules on StudOn are well structured and also practical for repeating  but they do not replace a presence lecture.  My level of competence regarding the topic is rather poor.     I am still dissatisfied with the solution of the written task.     In my reflection I was exceedingly honest and direct.     And I think I will have another look at the learning contents during the semester break  since my level of knowledge is still very manageable.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
44,The topic Klassenmamagement und Umgang mit Störungen is very interesting  however  I have not yet the super Durchblick and must deal with it more intensively.     I have put a lot of effort into it  however  I am not completely satisfied with it myself so far.     I think because I still have to deal with it a little more intensively.     thereby the alone learning (bspw. school pedagogy)     costs me a lot of time  I hope however for a good result and will look at me after receipt of the solutions still more exactly and make notes if necessary.     In my opinion  I did not fully understand what should be done as homework.     For this reason  I tried to make the best of it.     I especially enjoyed finding out what the conflict was about.     I focused specifically on the task and if something was not quite as understandable to me  I took the time to look into it a bit more.     Since the task already took some time  I assess my proposed solution with a grade of 3.     Whether this is correctly assessed  I do not know  of course.     Nevertheless  I did my best.     In general  I would recommend the task and topic 4  as an interesting area  because you can learn a lot here as a student but also as a teacher and refresh your skills a bit.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
45,Since there is a lot going on right now  I didn't approach the assignment with too much motivation.     However  since the topic interests me and I have found through my previous internships that it is very important to deal with classroom disruptions in order to be able to react appropriately and in a timely manner  it was not difficult for me to work on the assignment.     I had not prepared much at this point.     Thus  I first made my own thoughts about the case study  in order to subsequently compare and connect them with the lecture slides and literature.     It was not quite clear to me how detailed I should answer the respective question and whether the answer must/should refer exclusively to the slides or the literature.     It was fun to think/put myself in the situation and ponder how one would probably act in such a situation  and then in the second step research what techniques and theories exist.     Concentrated I was at that time already.     However  I had to set up a certain time window  and therefore keep it quite short.     Overall  I find the independent learning good  however  I often miss the exchange/discussion with fellow students*.     I rate my level of competence on the topic of class management and dealing with disruptions as good.     I can only poorly assess the solution to the written assignment  since I do not know the expectations and also do not know a comparison of other solutions.     Nevertheless  I am satisfied with the learning unit and think that I have dealt well with the topic and gained new knowledge especially by answering the task.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
46,I was not really motivated (new way of doing the task) but the topic is exciting in itself     I was very interested in the topic as this is one of the core fears one has as a teacher.     Therefore  it is very practice-oriented.- I was     good     on     the     task     prepared-     In the general processing of the case study  yes.     The further task was not very clear.     The practicality of the task on the later job (case study)-     I     was     concentrated during the case study-     I got along very well-     The handling of the case study was very good.     I did not find the reflection explained clearly enough.     Level of competence after processing is very good is-     I judge the solution of the case study as successful - my reflection is very critical  but also short because the task of reflection was very unclear and the structure of the entire work was not known.    I think I have understood the topic sufficiently,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
47,I have first tried to read the task and the case study soberly to get an overview of the task.     I felt up to the task.     At first I did not have much motivation to work on the task however this changed when I realized that it was not going to be as long as I initially thought.     The topic interested me because it is very reality-based and I think it will also have great relevance in my job.     I felt well prepared for this assignment by the lecture and the scripts.     I think I understood most of the assignment correctly and worked on it properly.     I got along well with the learning content as it was memorable and well structured     The written assignment was also not particularly difficult for me  although I found it somewhat problematic to write from the first person perspective.     I particularly enjoyed the analysis of the situation in the assignment.     I got along well with the written assignment because it was made clear and you had good clues.     I had the greatest difficulties with independent learning.     Working on the tasks or making the reflection was not that difficult for me.     I would claim that through the exercises and the learning content I now have an adequate level of competence in this field.     I have solved the task carefully and I think I have succeeded well.     I have oriented myself to the given guiding questions  therefore I think I have succeeded in the reflection in large parts.     I would consider the whole learning unit as positive for me.,"[1, 1, 1, 1]"
48,Before working on the task  I was a bit unsure about the situation and how to proceed.     However  I then looked at the learning content and worked through it to be able to process the case study as well as possible  as well as writing a summary to give me an overview.     So I was able to acquire a good prior knowledge and could start very quickly in the task.     Through the preparation I felt relatively well prepared only in some points there     there     nevertheless     for the time being     Uncertainties how exactly I have to proceed     The interest for this topic was present and I wanted to deal with it  but I was not aware of the relevance of the topic at the beginning.     At the beginning I looked at the task and read it carefully.     To gain more confidence I looked at a tip so I knew how to start describing the case study and write down the content.     Overall  I did well with the learning content and topic and was able to reproduce it in the assignment.     While working  I was focused on the task to complete it as well as possible.     In the course of the work I became aware of how important it is to deal with disturbances and how severe they can be.     Since I myself never experienced such extreme situations in my school days.     It was interesting to deal with the topic and good to know what to do in different situations.     After dealing with the situation  I feel I have gained a good overview of the topic of class management and dealing with disruptions.     I was able to understand the content well and reproduce it well.     Mostly I had the feeling that I had analyzed and worked on the case study correctly  but sometimes I still had doubts whether everything I wrote was correct.     Also my solution is comprehensible but perhaps a little too far from practice since I have too little real experience in this subject.     I have studied the subject a lot and now have a good knowledge of the content.     I just don't know how exactly one would react in the real situation.     In summary  I have a good basic knowledge with the topic and the case study and feel relatively well prepared.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
49,I felt well prepared for the task since I worked through the lecture slides and there was also a lot of literature to deepen the content  also I understood what to do after briefly asking my fellow students.     I approached the task with little motivation  but this changed in the course of the processing  probably because the topic appears to me as one of the most interesting challenges of the teaching profession.     I particularly enjoyed the opportunity to put myself in the role of the teacher  I got along well with the entire assignment overall  however  after a year of online study  I would like to study in presence again.     Since my motivation increased while working on the assignment  I coped well with the assignment and was also focused.     I judge my solution to the written assignment as good since I reverted to almost every one of the in-depth texts in which the various theories are explained in detail  which is why I also assess my level of competence on the subject matter as good.,"[0, 0, 1, 1]"
50,Beforehand  I first looked at the slides and the lecture recording  since I have had little contact with this topic from a professional point of view.     Subsequently  I approached the assignment and wrote down all spontaneous thoughts about it in order to record my first impression;     however  despite the preparation  I was somewhat at a loss as to how I should probably react professionally in the end if I came into the situation described     Applying the contents of the lecture to the situation described  thus giving a practical aspect to the theory  was an enlightening experience for me personally.     I am sure that as an experienced teacher one could have acted preventively at significantly more points in the run-up to the escalation and also the reaction to the escalation could have been even more professional than it was now possible for me from the theoretical perspective;     Overall  however  I am quite satisfied with my increase in knowledge after this written elaboration  but I am looking forward to gaining even more experience in dealing with disturbances and in class management in general in order to be able to act and react better in the future.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
51,Before I worked on the assignment  I worked on the slides on Class Management and thus had a rough overview of the topic.     I took some time to find a solution and appropriate reaction for the incident that made sense to me from an educational point of view  as I found it difficult to come up with an appropriate situation at first.     After thinking longer it was easy for me to develop the idea further and move on to an appropriate response.     I find the topic very interesting and feel it is very important for today's teaching profession  which is why I was motivated to solve the task.     I think that my approach to solving the problem is useful but definitely has room for improvement.     I enjoyed thinking about a challenging situation in everyday school life and I think it is very useful to work on such scenarios already in theory and to think about it.     I felt prepared because of the given slides which I worked on beforehand.,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
52,Since classroom disruptions will always happen in the everyday life of a teacher  I was very interested to deal with this topic.     As a teacher  one knows both perspectivesin the everyday life of a teacher* later.     You know how it was when you were a student yourself and your classmates (or even yourself) disturbed the lessons and can perhaps sometimes even better put yourself in certain situations.     The task was set in an understandable way  but still kept very open.     I had no problems with editing.     Through the set of slides and the literature that was listed with  I felt well prepared to work on this task.     Because first of all I read the task once briefly to understand what situation it is about and wrote down my first thoughts (without the knowledge of the slides or the literature).     Subsequently  I read through the respective set of slides for this task very carefully.     I made marks and wrote out important parts of the text.     When that was done  I went back to the task and read through it one more time.     This time I added to my newly learnedknowledge.     I tried to put myself in the teacher's place to understand what was happening.     I found working on the task very exciting and very interesting.     I found the editing of the task very exciting as already described above.     Because such situations can happen any time later in your own teacher*s everyday life.     Students are often unpredictable and have their moods.     I took a lot of time for this task and topic.     I also exchanged ideas with my sister  since she is a teacher herself.     I asked her about similar situations and what she did.     Finally  we discussed certain situations in class and thought about how one would best act in that situation.     As a student  I had often been very agitated as well  and now in retrospect  I try to better understand the teachers' actions at the time.     A lot of things I would have done exactly the same as my teachers did back then  some things differently.     There you see how different we are and how individually you go into some situations and solve them.     I find that extremely interesting.     There will be so many individual solutions to this problem and most of us would probably have always reacted a little differently.     In hindsight  I don't think there will be a right model solution for such a scenario.     It is good that we as students imagine such situations in advance and consider our own actions.     Surely it helps in the later teachers* everyday life  if such a similar situation would happen.     Nevertheless  it is still something different to work it out in writing instead of actually experiencing it.     I don't know if I would have really reacted in such a situation as in my execution described above.     Many factors play a role.     If one is already very irritable oneself as a teacher  has a bad day and a bad mood  one probably reacts differently at that moment than with a good mood and a good start to the day.     In conclusion  I think that this elaboration was very helpful to look again exactly at this topic.     If we had not done this  I honestly would not have spent so much time on it and would have taken away much less of this exciting topic.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
53,I had a lot of fun thinking about analyzing class management  so I approached the assignment euphorically.     It was a little hard for me to understand what exactly I needed to perform  after a while I did it as well as I could.     The text for the assignment was easy to understand and the set of slides on the topic is also very clearly laid out.     I am satisfied with my learning result  I learned a lot of new things about class management  which I might not have learned in the lecture per se  as I dealt with the topic more intensively.     Whether my written submission is also satisfactory  I can't say  but I did it to the best of my ability.,"[0, 0, 1, 0]"
54,I find the subject of class management very important and interesting.     To have a good classroom management  you have to deal with the subject very well.     Especially in case of conflicts  as a teacher you have to know how to proceed or how to avoid it.     I have to say  the listing on StudOn confused me a bit  because at first I didn't know exactly how to proceed  but then I understood it and I didn't find it difficult to work on in terms of content.     I still needed some tips and I also used it  which I found very helpful.     I habegemerkt that I already knew a lot without the documents on this topic.     So i.e. I would have acted intuitively in these situations apart from the specification on the documents.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
55,I approached it with less motivation because the online semester gives me some difficulties.     Being involved in youth work  I was generally interested in the subject matter.     Despite lack of preparation  it was easy to understand what was required.     Concentration was hard to find with the rather low motivation.     However  I was able to play good practical examples for the case study in my head due to my volunteer work.     After refreshing the slides  the processing was doable.     By refreshing the learning units and connecting them with my practical experience in social work  I assume to have understood the topic of class management and dealing with disturbances well.     I consider my solution to be appropriate.     I personally feel that the reflection took too much time than it should have.,"[0, 0, 1, 0]"
56,I read through the case study carefully and marked the key terms or crucial words.     Based on prior knowledge from previous lectures and my own experience from school and internships  I already had a rough intuitive idea of how to handle the situation.     However  of course  without having the necessary technical terminology.     My first impressions/thoughts were: Why does the behavior of the students change so suddenly?     What are the possible causes?     Do these lie only with the students or also with the teacher?     Could the behavior have been prevented and if so  how?     What consequences must be drawn?     However  I found it somewhat difficult at first to structure the analysis and the answer to the question precisely.     During the processing of the material  more and more parts fitted into my previously assumed hypothesis or my posed questions.     With the help of the definitions and explanations I was now able to justify my assumptions and better work out possible solutions.     The action matrix according to Becker also provided a good structure for the procedure.     The assignment confused me at first  but after reading the thought-provoking text  the division into analysis  i.e. prevention  and reaction  i.e. intervention  was logical and understandable.     The learning unit showed me that quite a few of my approaches were already intuitively going in the right direction.     However  it has helped me to bundle  structure and supplement my previous knowledge.     The learning result of this unit feels somewhat better consolidated and understood than that of the previous one  since I was able to deal with the contents more intensively and also more practically through the case study.     On the whole  I am satisfied with my result.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
57,I was very pleased to finally be able to apply what I had learned to a case study.     I found it the most interesting topic so far because the theory included direct possibilities for students and stimulated my creativity.     This assignment was very surprising and time consuming due to other courses  as it is additionally mandatory for the exam.     I think so.     Judging it with other fellow students on how they approached the assignment.     I think so;     as well as I could when the sun was shining outside !     Sometimes the transfer and arrangement of the asked solution was easy for me and sometimes  I succeeded less well.     But more of this kind  please.     That's good!     During corona time  individual real time meetings would not be amiss to see who you are dealing with.     Videos don't replace that.     Otherwise  an enriching experience.     It is okay  but can be expanded.     I think it needs repetition of all topics individually for me  because I try to take stuff on all topics at the same time and since it is a lot of input overall  it still needs time for repetition here.     That's just my working attitude.     It's a bit hard for me because I did the task on 2 days because was afraid of the time ultimatum  so there are definitely points I should like to revise.     It was a more intense approach to this topic than the previous ones and therefore judge.     I judge it as very good.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
58,I approached the task at hand here with a relatively high level of motivation  as I find the subject matter both very interesting and very important for our aspired professional image.     I also felt well prepared so far  as the lecture slides were structured in a very understandable way.     First  I looked at all the lecture slides again more closely and marked what seemed important to me.     This was followed by the attempt to summarize the most important in a text  which I partly did not succeed in doing  so that I unfortunately just stubbornly listed many points.     But despite everything  I got along quite well with the processing of the task.     After completing the work phase  the topic of class management has clearly become a bit clearer to me.     Through this task it was possible for me to put the learned theory into practice  even if it was theoretical  and I am of the opinion that such task formats should be increasingly integrated into the studies.,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
59,Before working on the exercise task  I kept my documents in order to be able to access them at appropriate points.     During the processing  I was actually quite sure about the understanding of the task already during the little thought process.     However  I still wanted to make sure and the little content tip then confirmed my feeling that I was on the right track.  After the processing  I would say that I have once again dealt with class management in greater depth through the case study.     Moreover  it was vivid for me because I put myself in the situation,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
60,The assignment on the topic of introduction to pedagogical diagnostics is good to work on.     However  I found it difficult to refer to the theory and to refer to the diagnostic instruments during the application.,"[0, 0, 1, 0]"
61,Very motivated!     I would like to be a teacher eventually!     It interests me in practice  not so much in scientific terms and structuring.     Well  through internship experiences.     I hope you will feed that back to me.     I edited it to my understanding.     Finding a possible solution for Ms. Klammer.     Yes.     I did well with the task.     I got along. ...     Certainly more competent in the subject matter before the exam than at the present time.     I solved the task according to my understanding.     Satisfactory.     Good.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
62,By discussing the topic in the basic seminar I got new ideas which contributed to the solution.     The topic is interesting because it is also very important in everyday school life.     I was well prepared.     Yes.     The analysis of the situation and finding solutions.     The case studies help.     These could be a little longer.     Yes.     No problems.     Good.     Good.     Quite okay.     Not detailed enough.     Still room for improvement.,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
63,I would say like to any other task  no more  no less motivated.     Until now I had not given much thought to educational diagnostics  however  during/after working on the tasks this changed and I became more aware of the importance .     In relation to the theoretical foundations  the materials from the course etc. quite well  personally  or intuitively or how exactly that then looks in practice of course less. well ...hopefully!     Most of all I enjoyed putting myself in the situation and thinking about how I would have done it myself in practice -     Was I focused while working?     Yes  quite - How did I cope with the written assignment on the topic of Introduction to Educational Diagnostics?     Quite well     How did I cope with the whole assignment (independent learning on StudOn  working on written assignments  making reflections) on the topic Introduction to Pedagogical Diagnostics?     With independent learning (especially without a lecture in which the material is talked through) I generally have my difficulties lately  but that is probably also somewhat due to personal circumstances.     Definitely a lot better than before  I generally find it easier to deal with content with practical relevance -     How do I evaluate my solution to the written assignment?     I find it difficult to assess - Now that I am almost at the end  how do I assess my reflection?     ...quite reflective - In conclusion  how do I assess my entire learning unit on the topic of Introduction to Educational Diagnostics?     For me personally the learning unit was quite helpful,"[1, 1, 1, 1]"
64,I worked on this topic directly after the topic block 4 and had therefore already eingefundr5.len.     However  my concentration dwindled a bit as a result and I (honestly) wanted to work through it quickly rather than really learn inquisitively.     While working on the assignment  I had to look up quite a bit for the first part  since it was hard for me to remember so many terms.     However  once I had written it  it was easy for me to apply them to Mrs. Klammer's situation.     In general  I noticed here that I enjoyed applying something more than reproducing it.     My learning success was not particularly great  since I had already heard the content almost identically in psychology last semester.     So it was more of a refresher than new knowledge.     Therefore  I also think that I was able to solve the task well and safely and I am satisfied with my result.     I could not pick up all aspects of diagnostics in the case study  however  I do not think it was the goal either.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
65,Before working on the task  I felt increasingly uncertain  especially with regard to my challenge in the first task  but again generally well prepared  since I had already looked at and worked through the lecture slides set to music  the scripts from the basic seminar and the lecture  and had read into the literature given.     This was again my first approach: Gather information and pre-inform as best I could on the subject matter  or provide understanding and an overview.     The contents were thereby prepared for me very understandably.     The second step was then an understanding of the work order and which form this elaboration should take.     I found the learning contents during the processing to be informative and logically very well comprehensible as well as practical.     The written assignment clearly asked for a short sketch of the topic area and subsequent observation as well as supplementary ideas and clearly marked out and narrowed down the task for me.     This gave me back much of the confidence I lacked prior to the assignment.     However  the openness to the form  scope  and structure that the processing of this task should encompass remained a factor of uncertainty for me.     Does the processing carry more of an examination task character or does it go more in the direction of homework in terms of processing.     This is reflected  as in the processing of the first task also in my elaboration.     I am very satisfied with my learning result with this learning unit  as with the first task.     I have discovered some new and action-guiding things for the design of lessons or the design of performance measurement of students for later practice and  in particular  I have also strengthened the theoretical knowledge on the legitimacy of the assessment and evaluation of performance as well as the theoretical knowledge on the further development of performance assessment processes.     The differentiating dimensions of diagnostics (Leutner 2001) were very memorable in this process and feel like good preparation for planning and applying diagnostics in later practice.     I am satisfied with the result of my written assignment  even though a residual uncertainty remains as to whether the assignment was answered appropriately and correctly in terms of content  form  and scope.     From my point of view  I addressed all points of the assignment and was able to draw some conclusions and options for action that were informative for me from the processing of the case study.,"[1, 1, 1, 0]"
66,The processing of the questions for topic 5 was more difficult than for topic 4  since the question was less clearly formulated,"[0, 0, 1, 0]"
67,This topic was relatively difficult for me to work on because I was not sure how exactly to approach the second part of the assignment.     When working on the case study  it was a little easier for me  because I then read into it a little more and I hope that I was able to master the task quite well as a result.,"[0, 0, 1, 0]"
68,Just like the first of the two tasks  this task was also profitable for my knowledge about this topic.     After I had worked through both the basic seminar and the lecture and had read the respective texts  whereby the learning module was really extremely helpful and comprehensibly structured and I had clearly summarized the contents  I began to deal with the task.     In addition  it helped immensely that various contents had already been addressed in other lectures (e.g. reference standards and quality criteria).In general      I can     I     say that this assignment was easier for me than the one on class management     The structure of the field of pedagogical diagnostics could be taken well from the slides of the lecture and the basic seminar  since a well understandable structure was already shown and explained there.     Due to the optimal explanation of the differences of the different pedagogical diagnostics (e.g. formative and summative performance measurement) in the slides and the learning module  the analysis and the suggestion for the improvement of the performance measurement in the case study was also easy to work on.     Of course  one always wonders if one has drawn the right conclusions  but all in all  the processing of the task worked excellently.     I hope the task was handled sufficiently and to your satisfaction.,"[1, 1, 1, 0]"
69,Rather moderately motivated  since I started relatively late with the task and was thus already in the middle of the exam stress for the exams - I find the topic very interesting -     Also rather moderately good  because you had to work out everything yourself and in some places in the lecture notes it was not explained exactly enough what is meant in doing topics - With the help of the tips I knew well what I should do exactly  without them I rather struggled.     I thought it was good that you could work with a concrete case study and thus establish a practical reference when working on the task -     Yes  I was concentrated when I took breaks in between every now and then-     As already mentioned above  I was able to cope well with the task with the help of the tips -     I get along better  if one to the slides  which are uploaded on studon additionally a lecture in the week is offered  in which someone can explain the topic perhaps again in other words and one can ask also directly Nachfragen in addition.     Very much better than before working on the task  because I have also read again a lot in the literature folder and thus again much to the topic to learn -     I think that I have found a good solution  but it is certainly expandable -     Just like the evaluation of my solution - I have taken a lot with me through the learning unit  what/ how/ according to which criteria is diagnosed/ what judgment errors there are/ etc. and also how teachers can involve the students  which will also certainly help you a lot for your later professional life in school,"[0, 0, 1, 1]"
70,First of all it was important to get an overview of the subject and above all to understand it.     So I partly edited summaries with marginal notes to make the topic more vivid to me.     It also helped for the task to look at other case studies from the experience workload of my mother  who is also a teacher  to get a practical understanding of the topic instead of just theoretical approaches.     Here I must confess that pedagogical diagnostics was quite a dry chunk for me to work on.     Which is probably related to the overlaps in the field of psychology.,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
71,Tried to put myself in the situation of the teacher and then with the help of the VL slides tried to work out a solution proposal.     A little more uncertain in this case study than in the first one  as I found it difficult to really provide concrete suggestions for solutions.     Mine are somewhat general  because I had the feeling that it is burning at all corners and it is not the one good tip for Ms. Klammer and it is also overall not only lacking in her diagnostic competence  but in her ability as a teacher  otherwise this situation would never have occurred so.     I had heard some of this already in the VL Introduction to GS Pedagogy.     However  many more aspects occurred in the school pedagogy and some emphases were placed differently.     I liked the learning contents.     As mentioned before  a bit more difficult than it was in the 1st case study  but I hope I still managed to get a solid result with some useful suggestions.     Quite satisfied  it is a very important subject area to take to heart as a teacher and has an important role in professional life.     The assessment errors of any kind should be avoided.     Hard to say  quite neutral.,"[1, 1, 1, 0]"
72,For this task  I found it harder to motivate myself.     The topic just hasn't been that exciting for me personally and the amount of information that was given on it was just quite a lot  which made me feel a bit overwhelmed and didn't even know where to start.     That's why I went for the largest amount of help possible.     I do think that I would have been able to manage it somehow on my own  but it's much more pleasant this way.     I especially enjoyed learning about the proper forms of performance measurement and feedback  etc.     I was able to work in a concentrated manner for the most part.     I managed quite well with the task after initial confusion in the end  thanks to the help provided by the tips.     Independent learning is still a bit difficult for me but I am learning and improving.     I think I was able to learn a lot about the subject matter and believe I can submit a pretty good solution.     My reflection is honest and I hope it helps.     The learning unit was not quite as interesting for me as the learning unit before but still an enrichment and an important part of the teacher training,"[1, 1, 1, 1]"
73,Even before looking at the assignment  I went through both lectures and the basic seminar on the topic to get a general understanding of Pedagogical Diagnostics.     Here  the focus was mainly on general information such as the definition.     Afterwards  I read through the question of the assignment and based on this  I worked through the different information again and noted down what could be useful for answering the question.     After that  I worked on the question in writing and referred to my notes to complete the task as fully as possible.     Afterwards  I again consulted the lecture and the basic seminar in order not to forget any important information.,"[1, 0, 0, 0]"
74,The example is very close to reality  as it shows that educational diagnostics is much more complex and multi-faceted than assumed.     The learning success of the students is in the interest of the students as well as in the interest of the teacher  so it is all the more gratifying that both sides can actively participate in it and that there are a number of methods to increase the learning effect of the students through pedagogical diagnostics.     Initially  it was not too easy to analyze the example because there are just many methods that a teacher can consider to measure students' performance.     An important factor in performance measurement tends to be disadvantaged is that grades tell relatively little about students' progress and individual efforts.     It would therefore make sense to redesign the performance survey that still exists in all schools  for which the analysis example offers many suggestions.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
75,Before one can structure educational diagnostics more precisely  one must define more precisely what it sets as its goal in the first place.     On the one hand  the pedagogical diagnostics determines prerequisites and conditions of planned teaching-learning     processes     on the other hand  it analyzes learning processes and establishes learning results.     Within this discipline different diagnostic procedures are found which can be subdivided according to certain aspects:     The status and process diagnosis consider the now status of students and their further development.     Different purposes such as vocational aptitude or promotion  degree of involvement (other-self diagnosis)  standardization of the procedure and the reference normorietiertheit divide that further.     However  the most important distinction forms the formal and summative performance measurement  that is  either a learning diagnosis as feedback to the student or a final determination of the achieved learning status.     The latter is particularly related to various standards.     Psychology gives us for this also still exact quality criteria  with which judgements can be determined more exactly.     Thereby exactly on objectivity (independence of the evaluation)  reliability (reliability of the procedures) and validity  which indicates the final validity of diagnostic judgements.     In the case study  the teacher uses few diagnostic procedures.     One is talking about a recent class assignment that unfortunately turned out very poorly and the other is regularly quizzing students on the board.     These are both times informal testing procedures or so-called teacher-made tests.     The class work as well as the queries on the blackboard both only determine the learning level of the students  but not their development and improvement.     The tests are both less standardized because the teacher is guided by class performance rather than references.     The class test  unlike the intercept  has a selective purpose and attempts to make vocational aptitude conclusive  while the intercepts are intended to be more remedial for students.     Up to now still nothing to the use came any procedures of the formative achievement diagnostics  which is to be understood as process diagnostics.     No learning objectives and assessment criteria were discussed  no opinions were asked for  and no discussions were started.     Formative performance measures are especially necessary for a more accurate picture of the performance level of the class.     A procedure that the teacher should use to even catch two birds with one stone would be to structure tasks in such a way that not only answers have to be written down but also justified and then also discussed in the group.     In doing so  one can recognize directly in class which students are still having a hard time  since these will contribute to the discussion rather less.     At the same time one provides thereby also for more cooperation at instruction  since there is now exchange between the pupils.     Equally well suited is the creation of concept maps or mind maps  by which one recognizes just as quickly which students have the overview and which do not.     Likewise tasks with increasing difficulty are suitable  with which one sees starting from which task a pupil already has difficulties and thus the learning level can be recognized fast.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
76,It is not enough to question individual students to determine their level of knowledge  it is important to maintain communication in class and to ask students specific questions without the pressure of a grade to get the best possible knowledge about the individual level of knowledge.     It is also advisable in advance of a test to observe individual students over a longer period of time and then evaluate them on the basis of their individual performance and improvement.     It can be advantageous to discuss the learning objectives with students in advance  so they know exactly what to expect.,"[0, 0, 0, 1]"
77,I found the topic block of educational diagnostics to be one of the most exciting.     On the one hand  diagnostics offers many possibilities to support students in the best way.     At the same time  it brings with it the danger of misjudgment.     I needed a lot of time at first to understand the diagnostic instruments individually  but also to understand them as an overall construct.     While working out the tasks  I read through the tips.     They gave me clues to lean along.     This made it easier for me to get started with the topic and I had the feeling that I could filter out the most important aspects better.     In general  I consider the elaboration tasks to be useful  because you get a concrete reality reference through the case studies.     The learned knowledge can be applied directly and understood better.     Often I had the feeling that many lectures are very theoretical and models are hardly applicable in reality  or you lack experience as a student  because at most you have already held a lesson yourself in the internship.     Through the case studies I have changed my opinion in this regard  because I had a concrete situation in front of my eyes  which can also take place in the real teaching event so or so similar.     This made it much easier for me to understand the models and in the end I dealt with them more intensively this way and did not just learn them mindlessly by heart.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
78,I find the subject matter very exciting and useful.     The lecture was good to follow and more practical than the other lectures  Also I think it is good to get tasks to the individual lectures and work on them so.     It helps me to remember topics better.     The editing went well.     However  I would have liked to have had an approximate scope guideline.     Since I didn't know if I wrote too little.     In conclusion  I find that the assignment helped me a lot to understand the lecture and also to apply it.,"[0, 0, 1, 1]"
79,Overall  I consider the topic of educational diagnostics to be very important for a teacher  so I am very interested in it.     Through the lecture slides I also felt well prepared for the assignment.     As with the other assignment for Module 4  it was not entirely clear to me in advance how detailed and extensive the answer to the assignment should be.     I thoroughly enjoyed the processing.     I can't really judge whether I answered the task fully  it may well be that you can go into more detail and give even more examples in the second part of the task.     In conclusion  I would already say that I have understood the central aspects of educational diagnostics and can also partially apply them.,"[0, 1, 1, 1]"
80,Of course  there are also empirical findings and criticism on the topics of pedagogical performance measurement.     Winter (2007) offers criticism of traditional performance measurement.     He summarizes the following points:     traditional performance measurement is predominantly cognitive and product oriented  there is no consideration of interindividual differences  and knowledge is tested only in morsels.     In addition  the teacher's assessment criteria are usually unknown and there is no sharing of how the assessment is conducted.     Thus  the teacher is the only assessment authority.     These aspects are thus no longer compatible with the new learning culture and lifelong learning in a globalized knowledge society.     Furthermore  there are results of the feedback research:     Good feedback has an informative function and reduces the discrepancy between the current performance and the desired learning goal.     Feedback should answer three questions according to Hattie & Timperley (2007):     What is the learning goal?     Where is the learner currently and what has been accomplished?     What specific steps are next?     Feedback can always refer to the task  process  self-regulation  and person levels.,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
81,Before writing  I downloaded PowerPoint presentation 9 and 10 and read them carefully.     I then used it in parallel with my Word document and my pdF,"[1, 0, 0, 0]"
82,Learning phase:     In the beginning  you could download the lecture slides  read through them carefully and work on them.     Here it is very helpful to make your own notes in the margin to get a quicker overview later and not have to look up much.     In addition  you can also write yourself a shorter summary with the most important points.     After editing the slides  it is helpful to go back to the notes/summaries and review them.     Work phase:     Before starting the task  it is useful to read through all the notes/summaries again so that you can then work on the task with refreshed knowledge.     A calm working atmosphere and tidy workplace are crucial in my opinion  especially at digital times  so that one is not too easily distracted.     Then you can read through the task and hopefully work on it well.     If one does not remember something exactly or would rather look it up  one can look it up in the notes/summaries or the lecture slides.,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
83,If one first deals with the literature and then remembers something back to one's own school days  some things are much easier for me.     A lot happens unconsciously and from the gut.     During the processing I became aware once again that one must always be aware of one's own role and be clear about the process and the associated path.     The processing  once you had a red thread  went very structured and purposeful.     Many things became clearer to one again and contexts could be better opened up to me in retrospect.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
84,Motivation from 1-10:     a good 7 -     The topic interests me less compared to the other topics of school pedagogy - I felt sufficiently and adequately prepared for the task -     The task was understandable.     the     Practical case study - concentration from 1-10: a good 8 -     I got along quite well with the written assignment on pedagogical diagnostics -     In general I get along well with the independent learning on StudOn     This also concerned the pedagogical diagnostics.     I think my level of competence on the topic of Introduction to Pedagogical Diagnostics is good.     - I find my solution appropriate and good -     I find my reflection very detailed-     I judge my whole learning unit as adequately successful.,"[1, 1, 1, 0]"
85,Before working on the topic  I studied the given slides.     The amount of information conveyed was quite intimidating and I hardly knew what exactly to start with.     Since I worked on the slides  as well as the written assignment in one piece (i.e. on the same day)  my motivation unfortunately left something to be desired and I felt a bit stressed.     During the processing  I was quickly distracted and not completely on the point  which subsided again in phases.     Especially in the last half of the editing time  I found it a little easier to focus  since I knew more what I wanted to write.     The assignment is formulated very openly  which made it difficult for me to assess which points I should list.     The notes in the learning sequence helped with this  however my answers were very much based on the slides.     Here I did not know to what extent this is desired/ wanted  respectively if a free formulation is desired.     This one was difficult for me  however  since it often depends on the exact wording in such definitions and it does not offer much room for free interpretation.     After the processing I definitely notice that I have acquired the topic well and now more about it is stored in my memory.     Unfortunately  I am absolutely unsure about the quality of my solution and it is very difficult for me to assess it  since I do not have a yardstick or a sample solution.,"[1, 1, 1, 0]"
86,Before working on the task  I showed a high level of interest in the topic  since diagnostics will later represent an important and challenging part of the teaching profession.     I imagined the grading in elementary school to be a bit easier.     While working on the assignment I had fun and curiosity to learn even more about educational diagnostics.     At the beginning I was more motivated  but after some slightly heavier and longer texts I became less concentrated and had a bit of a hard time understanding a few sub-areas  such as learning progress diagnostics and the difference or connection between summative and formative performance assessments.     After working through it  I can definitely say that performance measurement and assessment are not easy topics and should not be underestimated  especially on the job  because every child learns differently and acquires different skills at different times.     I was able to expand my knowledge and hope to keep this in mind and apply it in practice.,"[0, 1, 1, 1]"
87,Making judgments in a class and then especially in a math class can be difficult at times.     Judgment is always based on feedback from the class.     Teacher self-made tests can help but are always too personal in my opinion.     Having an external person with the students from time to time for a down-to-earth reflection of the learning content and level helps better.     As a soccer coach  I was recently allowed to take over a youth team.     The kids are 10 and 11 years old respectively.     I didn't know them or their abilities  so I first played a friendly match against a team I knew.     In the game I could see exactly what the kids can and can't do.     With my co-trainers have worked out the game afterwards and we could get a picture of the team.     By that I mean  self-made assessments are always too personal.     Someone external or an external test procedure such as a year stuff test are always Helpful  textbooks often have sample tasks that can be consulted or you invite someone external.,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
88,The field of educational diagnostics is a broad one  which is why I have been involved with the subject for quite some time.     In the end  I was able to learn a lot about performance assessment and pedagogical diagnostics  which will help me in my later professional life.     The processing of the set task was challenging for me in that it could have been processed in one/two sentences in my opinion and then I tried to do this in more detail taking several aspects into account.     I did not look at the tips on StudOn in this regard  but I still think that I was able to complete the task well.     Maybe I should have been more detailed in one or the other place  however I think that written contains the most important.,"[0, 0, 1, 1]"
89,Unlike the previous assignment on class management  this part was much more difficult.     Ped. diagnostics is more demanding from the material.     You have to read through the content several times to understand it.     In addition  this part was also not so strongly practice-oriented and therefore more difficult for me.     Nevertheless  it is interesting and important to learn and know about it.     I was able to learn the workload in the given time.     I think that in the end  with the assignments  I understood and comprehended the subject.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
90,At the beginning I could not really imagine much about pedagogical diagnostics and therefore I was also curious about the processing.     I got along well with the processing.     It took me a relatively long time because I could do little with the lecture content/slides.     But by reading up on the literature and the examples explained in detail in it  I got a good impression of the topic.     I could also work well with the case study.     Looking back  I was very interested in the topic and I feel like I got a good overview of the big topic.,"[0, 0, 1, 1]"
91,I found this task more difficult compared to the first task.     The case study was more difficult because the situation is ambiguous.     You can't identify the one mistake the teacher made.     There was not one correct solution  but many different ways Mrs. Klammer should have reacted and acted in the future.     During the processing I could remember a situation during my FSJ in a school where I also totally overestimated the student performance.     I realized that as a teacher  you face challenges every day that need to be addressed.     Especially when preparing performance surveys  many things should be well thought out and considered in order to create task types that can be mastered by all students if possible.     However  in my opinion      the     preparation     for     class tests     the most important     Of course  a student may have a bad day  or for various reasons may not perform as well as he/she would have been able to.     But it is the task of the teachers to convey the contents of the lessons in such a way that every student can understand and comprehend them.    If the results in a class assignment turn out as in the case study  the parents should look for possibilities together with the school to support the students as well as the teacher.     Ideally  the students experience motivation from the teacher  which encourages them to learn and actively participate in class.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
92,Before working on the task  I honestly could not imagine too much about the field of pedagogical diagnostics.     However  after reading through and working on the lecture slides  I already felt better prepared for the task  which was somewhat challenging  but also involved a not entirely unrealistic everyday situation.     This situation again highlighted for me the importance of educational diagnostics with formative performance measurement and knowledge of effective feedback.     And I learned something  for example  about the complexity of assessments and feedback and what one can possibly do wrong about it or still optimize it.     During the processing  I enjoyed learning about the different ways of performance and learning progress methods and that summative performance diagnostics also have their value  but should be complemented by various supportive formative measures.     I got along quite well with the whole assignment  finding the right literature or places was not always easy  but worked out in the end.     Overall  I would rate my level of competence better than before the processing especially since I  as a future teacher  intend to adopt some of the presented strategies and methods in my lessons  e.g. regarding comprehension questions or a kind of quiz at the end of the lesson.     Maybe because as a student I lacked these self-assessment opportunities.     I am quite satisfied with my solution to the task.,"[1, 1, 1, 1]"
93,Before working on the task I was very motivated to deal with the topic of pedagogical diagnostics because I understand it as an essential part of the teaching profession in the assessment of students' performance.     However  during the processing of the assignment  I was again demotivated by the case study that was not very meaningful  the little concrete tasks and the resulting need to resort to conjecture to analyze the situation from the case study.     Had I found more salient  directional key information in the case study and thus had clearer clues as to which passages from the literature were relevant and usable in answering the question  I would have worked on the assignment in more detail and taken even more time to do so.     Overall  I do not really have the impression that I have gained significant added value for my professional competence from reading the further literature  since the texts provided were so extensive and time-consuming to read that I have already forgotten a large part of their contents again during and after working on the task.     Please excuse my directness.     I don't mean to offend anyone with this  but just want to give honest feedback  and hope it helps in evaluating the work assignments/learning unit.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
94,I consider the topic very significant and therefore approached it with interest.     Through individual texts  the lecture videos and lecture slides I felt well prepared.     The assignment was also well understood.     Due to the fact that I have already worked on a  at least formally  similar assignment (on topic area 4)  I got along well with the entire assignment and the independent learning on StudOn.     Furthermore  the basic seminar Zoom sessions helped me.     In addition  I consider reflections very helpful and important to be informed about the state of one's competence.     While working on the task I was focused and found especially the 2nd part of the task exciting.     Fun       therefore  I especially enjoyed analyzing the situation described and figuring out the possibilities to help Ms. Klammer.     I think that I have a very good overview of the topic Introduction to Pedagogical Diagnostics and therefore I can also give a proper solution to the written task.     The learning unit was understandable and there is nothing that seemed incomprehensible to me.,"[0, 1, 1, 0]"
95,Through the detailed occupation with the topic Introduction to Pedagogical Diagnostics  it first becomes really clear to you what you have to pay attention to in Pedagogical Diagnostics.     It is important to know what the subject means in the first place and to get to know the psychological basics  which give great insight into the subject.     Furthermore  it is important to deal with the quality criteria and to consider and reflect on them in every work.     Knowledge of errors in judgment can be uncovered during one's own reflection and avoided in further teaching and performance measurement.     In a further step  the change of time has to be considered  which is why formative and summative performance measurement through empirical findings and critiques of the previous procedure help to make performance measurement easier and more transparent for all involved.     The new feedback culture helps the teacher to know about the competencies of the students and encourages an exchange with the children to promote further learning.     In fact  in the end  it is important to apply the individual reference norm in order to be able to evaluate criterially at the end of a teaching unit in a class work.     In conclusion  although pedagogical diagnostics is only one of many subject areas in school pedagogy  it is highly relevant to the teaching profession later in life.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
96,I tried to put myself in the position to see how I would act.     Not satisfied  I need to look at the part more closely to take more from it.,"[1, 0, 0, 1]"
97,To get a first overview I read through the slides of the lectures on educational diagnostics.     I found it especially interesting to inform myself about alternative forms of performance measurement and to find out that alternative methods are much more effective in the long-term teaching-learning process.     In the given literature I also found some interesting texts  which were helpful in working on the task.     However  I had problems with the first question in the beginning because I was not particularly sure what info from the lectures or literature was relevant to the assignment.     However  the tips given helped a lot.     In addition to that  it was helpful to write a short outline and thus structure the pile of information.     With the 2nd part of the task I had a little trouble  because I was not sure about the implementation.     Nevertheless  I can conclude by saying that I now definitely have more knowledge on the topic of diagnostics and would like to deepen this further.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
98,I found it very difficult to find an answer at first  what is meant by structuring pedagogical diagnostics.     I found the assignment itself again too general and would have liked a more concrete example.     However  the help was very purposeful this time.     In general  I found it difficult to bring in technical terms or expertise here again  although I succeeded much better this time.,"[0, 0, 1, 1]"
99,At the beginning of this teaching unit  I already had knowledge of the topic of feedback  due to my participation in a seminar as part of the training workshop.     I also already had knowledge about objectivity  validity and reliability as well as judgment errors due to a psychology lecture.     The other areas of the topic were previously unknown to me.     I dealt with the other topics within the framework of this teaching unit mainly with the help of the script and tried to solve the given task as best as possible.,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
100,The topic is very everyday oriented and therefore important to deal with  even if the elaboration of the topic has nevertheless presented itself as a challenge.     I would have welcomed an introductory lecture on this topic.     I hope I could explain most of the aspects clearly.     I understood it for the most part.,"[0, 1, 1, 1]"
101,I first looked at the assignment to get a rough overview of the topic.     After that I watched the recording of the lecture from 2015 and worked through the uploaded PowerPoint presentation.     After that  I took notes on what to write in the assignments.     While editing  I worked closely with the recording and Leutner's text.     I tried to structure my thoughts and also incorporate personal procedures.     I am satisfied with my learning outcome and find I have     the     subject matter     understood,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
102,At the beginning  I was rather less motivated to work on this assignment because the exam period is very soon and I need a lot of time to study.     However  after I read up a bit  I found it a little easier to write a lot about the topic.     I think the topic of this assignment was well chosen.     Each student has the opportunity to contribute their own ideas to improve the problem described  because it is a very broad topic with many alternative actions.     It is also an interesting topic.     I didn't think that diagnostics can affect students so much.     It also took me less time to work on this topic because I already knew what was expected of us from the first assignment.     The tips helped me well again because they guided me in a direction through which I got a lot of food for thought.     I am satisfied with my elaboration because at the beginning I did not think that I would come up with so many ways.     Working out this assignment also helped me a lot to understand what exactly is meant by the points described in the slides and I feel well informed now.,"[1, 1, 1, 1]"
103,Before working on the task I felt very challenged.     I felt like I didn't really understand ene amount of the material covered in the lecture and literature.     The assignment seemed much more challenging than the last one and I had little motivation to complete it.     While working on the assignment  I understood the topic better and better because I had to deal with the material very actively.     However  I still felt that my understanding was shaky.     I think this is largely due to the fact that my knowledge of German is sometimes deficient and I find Leutner's text in particular to be complicated.     Due to my comprehension problems  I often lost concentration while working and was quite frustrated.     I still felt that the first assignment was much easier or more manageable than this one.     I judge my level of competence on the topic as acceptable.     I judge my solution even to the written task as relatively poor because I had difficulty recognizing the various diagnostic instruments in Ms. Klammer's class.     Overall  I judge my entire learning unit as sufficient.     It would probably be useful to revisit this topic at a later date to deepen my knowledge.,"[0, 1, 1, 1]"
104,The topic of Educational Diagnostics is a very important topic to recognize as a teacher how knowledge can be communicated to the whole class as well as to individual students.     This topic will also be looked at more closely in further internships.,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
105,For now  this task seems much harder than the last one.     After watching the lectures and looking at the texts  this topic seems much more challenging to me than the one from the last assignment.     I also had understanding in many places in the lecture     problems     so I hope those will clear up for the most part as I go along.     Now that I'm halfway through the assignment has become much clearer to me than before.     Partly I am still overwhelmed with many of the texts  and I also still have a few problems myself to determine diagnoses and to relate them to the classifications but I hope when I now work on the second task that this will become clearer to me.     Working and how well it goes comes in waves.     When I have to switch from text to text  I get out now and then and then I find it a bit difficult     To retrace my previous train of thought     Now that I'm done with the work I have the feeling that I understand much more than at the beginning.     I don't feel quite as satisfied as I did with the previous work but I did my best and I hope it will be enough.     The second task went much more pleasantly than the first  because by then I had already accumulated information that I could use.     I think I have     the     task     relatively well  because I tried to add as many references as possible and to connect them     Overall  this learning unit was relatively difficult but I also found it interesting especially on the topic of grades and that these are actually not the best way to conduct educational diagnostics.,"[1, 1, 1, 1]"
106,Due to external influences (massive stress at work)     I was frankly not very motivated.     Although I was excited about the topic  however  it quickly turned out for me that there was no great added value for me  since I have already been successfully teaching part-time for several years and intuitively did a lot of things right.     This only strengthened me in my attitude that much is due to experience  knowledge of human nature and knowing one's students.     In principle  I got along well.     Independent learning and working out the contents is natural for me  since I already have a degree and through experience with various lecturers prefer to work out the topics on my own.     Regardless of the tasks here  I rate my level of competence highly  as I have now successfully taught students for the past 7 years and they have been able to improve their grades by up to three grade levels.     I have developed my own technique in the past on how to get a confident assessment of my students  which excitingly is very much in line with the theoretical principles.,"[1, 1, 1, 0]"
107,Like last time  I created my own summaries to find the common thread.     Afterwards I read through everything again and put it next to me to work on the assignment.,"[1, 0, 0, 0]"
108,Frankly speaking  the task on topic area four appeals to me more because I think dealing with non-behavioral normative students* is one of the biggest tasks of the teacher.     Of course  pedagogical diagnostics is also a very important field  which  however  currently  due to my self-assessment as a clearly more people-oriented than performance-oriented teacher  has somewhat taken a back seat.     In my opinion  the tasks were also a little more demanding than those on topic four  without the tips I probably would not have been able to answer them satisfactorily.     Through the given literature in conjunction with the set of slides  I was able to solve the assignment.     However  I could not do this in one piece and so it also took me a few minutes each time to think my way back into the task.     In general  I find exclusively digital teaching very difficult.     A collective discussion and elaboration of (learning) results is very lacking for me.     Of course  also the contacts within a seminar or lecture and generally a student life.     A reflection on my elaboration is quite difficult for me  because I do not know a correct answer.     I have answered the task as well as I could and I am also satisfied with my answer  although I do not know if it is correct.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
109,The first topic  class management and dealing with disruptions  was much easier for me than this one.     This was probably partly because the first topic was only one lecture and this one was two  and partly because you heard even less about diagnostics.     After I worked through the lectures  I additionally read up on the subject with further literature and looked up some terms on the Internet.     Little by little  the puzzle then came together and the connection between the individual facts became clearer to me.,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
110,Before the processing: I found it difficult to work steadily with the slides     because I lacked a weekly routine.     The lack of learning groups reinforced the whole thing.     Furthermore  I found it difficult to communicate via the forum.     This put me behind schedule and I quickly got into a vortex of procrastination.     In addition  I lacked information at the beginning so that I could understand how to approach the tasks during the processing:     The concentrated work is very difficult for me.     I miss a certain alternation to the digital work.     As already mentioned  I had to catch up on some things and felt a little overwhelmed (caught off guard) since there were quite a few slides in part 5 Diagnostics.     Thereby I had partly a little less joy with the processing as compared to the first task since one could work there somewhat more intuitively.     The processing of the second part of the task was much easier for me and was also more fun.     After processing: I have processed the topic of diagnostics  but I have to realize that it is difficult for me to assess which parts are possibly important for the state exam.     The topic of diagnostics became steadily clearer the longer one dealt with it     In retrospect  I find this type of exam very successful  because it makes you deal with the topic much more than with conventional exams.     Grade with these the bulimia learning is strengthened and is thus quite contradictory almost already cynically grade in courses of studies such as pedagogy.,"[1, 1, 1, 1]"
111,Reflection before the work phase:     I approached the task optimistically  since much was already very clear to me through the basic seminar.     The topic interested me very much  because grading in school life now always brings a rather negative undertone with it.     Despite all this  it is necessary and can be helpful in the right measure  for example  in targeted promotion.     Reflection during the work phase:     Even as in the processing of the first workload  I was able to work in a concentrated manner and productively with the help of the task folder and the includedTips.     Thus  in summary  I can say that I coped well with the workload.     Reflection after the work phase: my level of competence has expanded again times.     I find the processing of the task as well as the reflection very conducive.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
112,Before working on the task I was not quite clear about the exact areas of pedagogical diagnostics  after working on the task I am now quite sure that I can name as well as describe all relevant areas and fields.     Through the slides as well as the literature I felt very well prepared and then approached the processing of the case study with motivation.     I understood that the teacher in the example performs all the classical features of a traditional performance survey and now the latest findings have to be mentioned as suggestions.     I coped very well with the complete material and the assignment and understood the topic of educational diagnostics well and reflected well on my own learning progress.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
113,Through the lecture  slides and the basic seminar I felt well prepared for the assignment  however  at the beginning it was a bit difficult for me to understand the first assignment.     With the help of the tips  I knew better afterwards what was asked and what was not  and I was able to read up a bit more about it on the Internet and in the literature.     I then first wrote down key points on a sheet and wrote down my thoughts on the topic  which helped me a lot to sort everything out.     In addition  I worked with the help of the set of slides and looked at a few tips on this.     This helped me to cope better and to work on the tasks  because from time to time I didn't know exactly what you have to pay attention to in the task and what was asked.     At the end. I then summarized everything and wrote it down as a document  which was easy for me because I had already written everything on a piece of paper before.     As with the previous task  I enjoyed working and getting to grips with the topic and I was clearly more engaged with the subject than if I had only had to learn it by heart.     In retrospect  I am satisfied with my processing of the task.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
114,Motivation a little less than last time thanks to anticipation of reflection.     Accomplished well.     Learning result satisfied  tips for handling in practice super,"[0, 1, 1, 0]"
115,Honestly  I did not approach the task so motivated.     Not because of working on the case study - this helps a lot!     Much more because of the division of the reflections into so many separate parts  a collected learning sequence on this would do.     Didn't quite understand what was to be done in the assignment at the beginning  but then I did.     It is interesting to apply what you have learned to the case study - even if you use your own script to help with this  you still or more than ever have the feeling that the learning content takes hold.     Am satisfied with the solution and what I learned.,"[1, 1, 1, 0]"
116,Before I worked on the assignment  I read through the lecture slides on the topic Introduction to Educational Diagnostics in detail and summarized them to quickly get an overview of the whole topic.     When I then began to deal with the case study I first read up again on the different types of educational diagnostics and already noted down several procedures.     Thereupon I analyzed in more detail which procedures had already been used by the teacher.     Thereupon I selected exactly those procedures  which provide the teacher fastest and simplest more clarity over the achievement conditions of their pupils.,"[1, 0, 0, 0]"
117,Before editing: again  I had a hard time understanding exactly what I needed to accomplish.     After editing:Despite clear slides and learning materials  I found this topic quite more difficult.     I still learned a lot and hopefully was able to complete the task properly.,"[0, 0, 1, 1]"
118,The topic was worked on by me in such a way that I first read through the lecture slides in a concentrated way.     Afterwards  I watched the lecture video for this purpose.     This helped me to understand the contents better.     Also the now following processing supported me to connect the learned contents with practical examples.     In particular  it allowed me to practice learning about the complexity and diversity of diagnostics.     In the subsequent task  it now became even more clear how significant it is to resort to balanced and high-quality diagnostic methods.     I also resolved to pay attention in internships to which diagnostic methods are used by different teachers in order to observe direct practical application and to gather ideas for my own teaching activities.     In addition  this seems to me to be a good exercise for reflection on the applied diagnostics and  if necessary  on errors that occur in the process  because also in my later teaching activity  as has become extremely clear in this chapter  it will be very important to check one's own diagnostic procedures again and again in order to avoid errors and to enable professional judging.     Because the high importance of a good diagnosis for successful teaching is one of the core aspects I took away from this learning section.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
119,Due to the scope of the lectures  I find it difficult to respond adequately to such open-ended questions.     Also  the script  which in my opinion is not optimally structured  does not make autodidactic learning any easier and the recorded lectures are available in miserable sound quality.     Overall  I think an assignment with more small subtasks that cover the entire material little by little would be more useful than an assignment in whose answer consists of parts that are spread over 95% of the slides.     However  equalizing the exam material through such tasks is a sensible solution.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
120,This topic is interesting and  of course  elementary for later everyday work.     The preparation through the lecture slides seemed sufficient to me  as I found the questions well understandable and appropriate to the topic.     During the work: I had fun during the processing especially at the summary of the info  because this gave again a comprehensive overview of all aspects of the topic.     I was concentrated and coped well with the assignment and the resulting work steps.     In general  the digital learning on this lecture is good and clear.     After the work: I feel now well informed about the subject Pedagog. Diag.     And was able to tie some things to my prior knowledge and thereby supplement this.     I think my task has done justice to the criteria and the processing points.     Overall  this learning unit was very good and very positive for me.,"[0, 0, 1, 1]"
121,I was not strongly motivated.     My motivation only stemmed from the fact that I had to do this assignment in order to be able to participate in the exam.     Assignment on the topic Introduction to Pedagogical DiagnosticsBefore     the editing     the term did not mean much to me  accordingly I had little interest in it.     I did not feel well prepared.     Without the help I would not have understood especially the first part question.     I enjoyed constructing a proposed solution for the case study.     Most of the time I was focused.     I had trouble figuring out exactly how to approach it and I still doubt now if I worked it correctly.     Due to the fact that we had no lectures this semester  it was hard for me to keep this course in mind  let alone develop an active interest in the content.     This also made the written assignments more difficult.     I understand some basic aspects  however  I cannot say that I have mastered the COMPLETE content.     I think my solution could be more detailed and there are definitely important aspects missing that I overlooked.     You can see that I had difficulties with the online lessons and that I had little motivation in general.     Nevertheless  I recognize an urge to understand the discussed material nevertheless,"[1, 1, 1, 1]"
122,I find the topic around pedagogical diagnostics very interesting and I also liked the case study.     However  I then found it very difficult because  especially in the first task  I didn't really know what to write.     That's why I also had to look at the tips in the learning sequence.     The second question with practical application of the theoretically acquired knowledge was fun for me  could motivate me here also more to stay on the ball.     With the written task  as already mentioned above  I had a hard time especially at the beginning.     With the entire task and the self-working out of the material I came in this case also generally not so well to cope  because I found it in the slides somewhat confused.     I personally liked that much better with the slides on topic 4  or rather I got along with it better.     I personally feel like I understood the main message of the topic  but not in the subtleties.     I think my written assignment turned out better in some places than in others.     My reflection shows that I definitely had a harder time with this assignment than with the one on topic 4 and also had to invest significantly more time  but the topic itself is definitely interesting  especially for the future.     I am curious to see what all is in the expectation horizon.,"[1, 1, 1, 1]"
123,I approached the work phase in such a way that I worked through the material on it again first.     Then I read through the task and tried to solve it with the help of the presentation.     I gave my best while working on it and I am actually satisfied with my thoughts on this topic.,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
124,This task was more difficult for me than the other one  because I found it a bit more difficult in terms of content.     First  I marked the most important things in the case study  which serve to answer the questions.     After that  I went back to the slides and wrote out the most relevant for me.     In addition  looked up things where I was not quite sure.     I had a tip given to me and oriented myself to it  whereby it was then somewhat easier for me.     But I didn't want to take more tips  because I wanted to do it mostly on my own.     I also found this case study very interesting and learned things about how to deal with such a situation.     After all  this may be the case in reality in the future.,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
125,I personally found the learning and working phase on the topic of pedagogical diagnostics to be a bit more demanding than the one on the first topic  but this may possibly also be due to the scope of the lecture.     In addition  I was able to work on the topic on teaching disruption better and easier in the questions  because it was closer to what one has experienced so personally in one's own school days.     For both topics  I proceeded in such a way that I first worked through the lecture/s and then made my own notes.     I then referred back to these when working on the topics.,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
126,For the topic Introduction to Pedagogical Diagnostics  I proceeded as follows:     First  I looked at the previous semesters' notes and made notes on the uploaded files.     Afterwards  I went through them again and then created an individual summary for myself  which I have now worked with in order to get an overview more quickly.     Reflecting on this method  I have to say frankly that I have been working this way for quite some time and am very satisfied.     I have found out for me that it is not so important to hear or read the lecture  but the most effective step is actually writing down myself  since I am thereby forced to bring my own structure into the subject and me so  connections become clearer.,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
127,I approached the task very motivated and I was very interested in the introduction of pedagogical diagnostics.     I also felt prepared and I also understood the task.     When working on the task  I was concentrated and I coped well with the topic.     I coped well with the topic & this learning unit was also very interesting.,"[0, 1, 1, 0]"
128,Not so motivated.     The topic is very interesting.     I read through the lecture and took notes on it.  At first it was hard for me to understand what exactly I should write down     but     with the help it worked out quite well.     I especially enjoyed putting myself in the teacher's shoes because it brought you closer to the practice.     During the working phase I was concentrated.     I managed quite well when working on the questions with the help of the assistance.     I didn't quite understand some of the topics  but I tried as hard as I could to answer the questions correctly.     I found the slides on the topic Introduction to Educational Diagnostics very understandable and helpful for working through the assignment.     I think I got a good overview of this topic.,"[1, 1, 1, 0]"
129,I did not feel very well prepared for the assignment.     However  it's probably because I didn't study the topic in depth  since it won't come up in the exam.     However  I actually find this very unfortunate  since the topic interests me very much in principle.     For me it was difficult to concentrate on the task  I miss the common discussing and discussing in a real lecture.     The learning modules on StudOn are well structured and also practical for repeating  but they do not replace a presence lecture.     My level of competence regarding the topic is rather poor.     I am still dissatisfied with the solution of the written task.     In my reflection I was exceedingly honest and direct.     And I think I will look at the learning content again during the semester break  since my level of knowledge is still very manageable.,"[0, 0, 1, 1]"
130,Since I already did different internships in school and took Psychology 1  I already knew some diagnostic methods that can be used as a teacher in school.     I also already dealt with the topic of feedback  as this was part of a workshop I attended.     However  thinking through these two aspects so concretely and precisely in a fictitious - but in principle real - situation has provided me with completely different approaches once again.     With the lecture slides I worked my way through this learning unit piece by piece and deepened the material once again.,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
131,The subject matter is very interesting for me  however  I still have to deal with the individual parts a little more closely.     I think that my homework is not the best  however  I have made an effort here to make good progress.     I think it would help me further  if one gets to the respective topics evtl a solution suggestion after delivery.     So one can see what is well and badly done.     Thereby the alone learning (bspw. school pedagogy) me very much time costs  I hope however for a good result and/or the confirmation  which I may write the examination.     In my opinion  I have understood what is to be done as homework  but I lack partly in the implementation (disagreement  whether bullet points or but sentences ...).fun     I especially enjoyed the first task  because here I presented the pedagogical diagnostics in relation to the case study once exactly and simplified and added my own key points  which make it a little easier for me to understand the whole thing.     I focused specifically on the task and if something was not quite as understandable to me  I took the time to look into it a bit more.     Since the task has already taken some time  I assess my proposed solution with the grade 2.     Whether this is correctly graded  I do not know  of course.     Nevertheless  I did my best.     In general  I would recommend the assignment and topic Introduction to Pedagogical Diagnostics as a very interesting area  because you can learn a lot here as a student but also as a teacher and refresh your skills a bit,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
132,In contrast to the previous task Class management and dealing with disturbances  I found it somewhat more difficult to familiarize myself with the subject matter in this task.     Probably this was due to the fact that the practical relevance was not so strong and the own experience could not (yet) flow into it.     Nevertheless  I found the topic interesting and was able to work through the learning content quite continuously  in combination with the written assignment.     Again  it was fun to put myself in a situation  to try to deal with a certain situation as a teacher.     The not much time available  again limited the working process.     However  I was focused on the task and thus was able to complete the task in a reasonable time frame.     The independent learning and editing of the written assignment also suited me well due to the lack of time.     In general  however  I prefer the exchange with fellow students.     I think that I was able to take some things with me in this learning unit.     So I am quite satisfied with this one.,"[1, 1, 1, 1]"
133,How did I approach the situation?     How did I feel?-I     have     read through and worked on the slides to be able to work on the questions     to be able to-I was pleased to learn something more     PD and disruption in the classroom to learn     How did I do with the learning content?     How did I cope with the written assignment?-I have     a     a little     to understand the structure behind the slides and thus then to be able to better structure the learning content in my head     to be able to-the     written tasks are clearly formulated and if you were not quite sure with the processing  you could read up on tips and help on Studon  which I find very good.     How satisfied am I with my learning outcome?     How satisfied am I with my learning outcome?-satisfied-also     Satisfied,"[1, 1, 1, 0]"
134,I approached with motivation-     The subject matter interests me rather less compared to others  but it is still exciting-     With the look of the lecture I felt adequately prepared for the task-     I understood the task.     The case study was the most fun-     While working I concentrated consistently-     I got along well with the elaboration -     The type of assignment is not my favorite but it is effective for learning the content.     I feel eminently competent in the subject matter-     I judge my solution as very successful-     I am honest  I never know exactly what to write and how much to go in depth (but I answered them conscientiously)-     I feel very well versed in the subject therefore I evaluate the learning unit positively,"[0, 1, 1, 1]"
135,As in the other exercise  I tried to go through the exercise objectively.     This time I had more respect for the exercise since the learning content was bigger.     This time my motivation was much lower  because the topic does not appeal to me so much and as already mentioned it was significantly more material.     I felt reasonably well prepared for the task  but it was still difficult to understand.     I didn't get along so well with the learning content this time because it was significantly more and it wasn't structured well enough for me.     The first part of the task was relatively difficult for me because I didn't know what to do at the beginning.     The second part was much more pleasant to work on.     I enjoyed the second part a lot as it was again reality based.     I had a hard time with the first part of the assignment  which is due to the large area that the assignment covers.     I found the whole unit a bit harder  however it is definitely achievable.     I am not so at peace with my learning result this time  because I still can't imagine everything.     With the written task I worked on the second part well     However  in my opinion  I have gaps in the first.     I consider my level of competence to be okay.     I can definitely improve in this area.     I solved the second part well  which unfortunately I cannot say about the first part.     My reflection is again relatively detailed and shows me myself that I still have weaknesses in this area.     I consider my entire learning unit as sufficient  because as I said I can still improve.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
136,In this case study I had a little more confidence before  because I had worked on the other example before.     It took away my uncertainty and I didn't have to think so much about how to proceed.     As with the other topic  I wrote a detailed summary first to prepare myself for the topic and to get an overview of the points.     The interest was there  however  I could not imagine so much about it at the beginning.     However  this cleared up in the preparation and I knew so better about the topic.     Nevertheless  I also wanted to manage this task well and I approached the work with motivation.     I got along well with the learning content for the most part     However  it was more difficult for me to grasp the right points and use them for the example.     But the longer I worked on the topic  the better I was able to implement the points and come to a conclusion.     I got along well with the first part of the written task     In the second part there was a lot of content where I first had to filter out the most important information in order to use it for the task.     While working I was focused and I tried to include all the points.     Otherwise I coped relatively well with the topic in general and also the task could be worked on well.     I am satisfied with my result in the written assignment and I have learned more for myself about the subject matter.     I have the feeling to have dealt well with the topic and to know about the topic.     I feel that the solution of my written task was relatively well done  because I tried to include all aspects and suggestions for improvement.     I was also able to process the reflection well and describe my feelings and sensations before  during and after processing the case study.     The learning unit went well     I had sometimes problems to filter out the right points where the problems are or what measures can be taken.     But in the end I dealt with it long enough to now know better what the different problems were and knew how to solve them.,"[1, 1, 1, 1]"
137,Reflection on my situation before the work phase:     I am motivated to work  because I am interested in the topic  and I also have the feeling that I have understood the task and the topic Introduction to Pedagogical Diagnostics.     Reflection of my situation during the work:     I got along well with the written processing  because I had a lot of assistance  also I manage to learn independently and to work on the tasks  however  I would rather learn in the social Umfelden.     Reflection of my situation after the processing:     I judge my level of competence and my processing of the task as good because I was provided with detailed literature in which I could read everything.     I judge my reflection as intensive I would rate the learning unit as well done.,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
138,The active engagement with the subject matter using a practical example  promotes active engagement with the subject matter and makes the material of the lectures more tangible through a theoretical practical experience and sensitizes us students as future teachers to always reflect and question ourselves  so that the quality of teaching can be improved.     In addition  active engagement helps to ensure that what is learned can be better processed and is not erased from the brain immediately after the exam.     However  it is easier if the case study is already included in the file.,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
139,The subject area of pedagogical diagnostics is of central importance for a prospective teacher - but due to the complexity for me personally a real challenge.     Therefore  I have already thought a lot about the subject area in advance  but was only partially satisfied with my findings.     The written task was not easy for me overall  because due to the complexity of the subject area many aspects are to be considered and also from learning contents not everything was completely opened up to me  although I have completely worked through the video recordings of the VL  the basic seminar and the tutorial.,"[0, 1, 1, 1]"
140,The task was easy for me because I read through the corresponding slides beforehand.     Furthermore  I created a corresponding overview for myself  so that I could derive different approaches and solutions from it.     I enjoyed working on this module because you got an insight into the later professional field and could deal with a realistic and challenging situation.     I found the slides very informative and helpful in completing the assignment.     I was able to take a lot from the learning module by working on the practical task reference.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
141,I am very interested in the topic  however  it has been very extensive.     It took me a lot of time to go through and understand all the slides.     Nevertheless  I found working on the task very exciting.     Because such a scenario can happen to any teacher in their future professional life.     By intensively dealing with the topic  I have a much greater understanding in the future.     At the beginning  I had a little difficulty with the topic and had to read up longer.     Especially because there were so many slides on it.     Overall  I found working on this assignment more difficult than working on the first assignment.     I intensively studied this topic thanks to working on the task.     It is a very complex subject and this elaboration of the situation makes it easier to understand.     As with the last time I worked on the assignment  I think that by working intensively and doing research  one will have more in mind in the future than by just memorizing for the exam.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
142,When working on this topic  it requires close attention to detail  as I think it is a complex issue.     With the help of a summary  which I made for myself and with the help of the associated seminar  in which this topic was examined in more detail  I was able to bring in a structure for myself.     It always helps me to connect the learned theory with practice and to illustrate it with a possible case study.,"[0, 0, 1, 0]"
143,In my opinion  I did not find it as difficult as I would have expected to get started with the other materials.     In my learning processes it helps me immensely at the beginning to have an overview of the extent of the topic I want to acquire.     So I can better locate individual contents and link them to further information.aher     I found the overview that the proseminar provided by addressing several subfields very helpful.     Also  that individual things such as self fulfilling prophecy  i.e. the assumptions and expectations of one person about another  have the tendency to prove themselves true by influencing behavior has already been covered in other lectures such as in elementary school pedagogy has helped my understanding.     This allows me to focus on new topics that I am not yet familiar with.     For a more detailed overview I went through the set of slides that I had already taken as a guide during the proseminar.     In itself  I could not really connect anything with the terms Pedagogical Diagnostics at the very beginning  because I did not want to create any mis-connections.     With such I often confuse myself  since I store both associations.     Therefore  in a way  I wait to link the term until I find an official source.     In other words a note from a teacher  or something fixed in the slide set  etc....     So I also avoid remembering something vaguely  but then not being able to put it into words.     However  this way of connecting a topic concretely with the facts only when I have a reliable source (helpful for exams) makes it difficult for me sometimes to ask questions at the beginning of the topic.     Since I have quasi still no opinion to the topic  since I connect it still with nothing.     To ask at the beginning for a clarification  or explanation to the facts connected with the topic would probably help me there.     And is something I will try to implement in the future.     To revisit the content and possibly get another explanation from a different angle  I still listen to the lecture notes following my review of the slide set.     So quasi have already heard of everything and made connections.     Also  I usually notice areas that I need to look at more closely and review.     These are usually areas that don't intrinsically intersect with my interests  or that I haven't completely understood yet.     Being able to absorb information poorly due to the form of the day is also sometimes a reason.     The problem of interest can usually be solved by thinking around  especially in social and educational topics.     Because such content can be well linked with content of everyday life (unfortunately  because the topic of performance assessment and learning progress analysis in our home is unfortunately associated with negative experiences)  but also because it ishilfreich for interests such as story writing task on the topic of introduction to educational diagnostics.     So I can increase my interest in a topic that in itself is quite extensive and not directly related to interests  so and motivate myself for it.     If there are still parts that have not stuck I have to repeat them again with the set of slides  possibly write them down again myself.     Here in this topic  for example  the classification of diagnostic instruments according to Leutner.     Since here the exact terms are necessary to be learned.     In general  I am never satisfied with my learning result  because I know how much more others can absorb  retain and  above all  put into words from the subject.     But in a way I am satisfied  because I know that is what I have absorbed and  above all  understood in the time given to me.     Without breaking myself by cramming until two in the morning.     So in conclusion ... trying to understand the subject  find interest in it and suspension points with which I can remember content easier.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
144,The written assignment was clearly stated  however I approached the assignment with rather mixed feelings as I did not know exactly what was required of me.     In order to understand the topic  I took the set of slides by Prof. Dr. Gläser-Zikuda to hand  however  I found it rather unstructured or it did not help me personally much in understanding the diagnostics.     After a certain time  however  it went.     I don't think my submission went well because I also had a hard time understanding the subject  I still did it with my best conscience.     Now  however  I have dealt with the subject more intensively and have definitely learned new things.,"[0, 1, 1, 0]"
145,Honestly  I was a bit unsure about the first question and I also don't know if that was required of me as well.     So to structure the content better  I created a table.     This table has also helped me in understanding the content  because I had to think a few times and look up whether this can now be so true.     I'm not completely satisfied with my result in the first task  because I also don't know if it's true that way.     I could work on the second task more easily and I think my result in this task is good.,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
146,I was very motivated.     At first I thought that it was a rather uninteresting topic however I found the content very important and therefore also very interesting.     Prepared I was not actually however I could by the available. Vorlesungsfolien me during the processing much extract.     I find the tasks were very difficult  so that I did not know directly what to do at the beginning     It was fun for me to learn something new.     I was not concentrated at the beginning so I left the learning sequence and resumed it a few days later. quite good.     Actually  I find it quite relaxing  however  sometimes it can become very tiring to boot up the PC and start the exercise.     I am now very familiar with the subject.     - I am satisfied with my solutions to the respective questions.,"[0, 1, 1, 1]"
147,A psychology lecture already provided me with some knowledge in the area of validity  judgment error  and objectivity.     Thanks to participation in the block seminar on school pedagogy at the beginning of the semester and a didactics lecture  I already possessed a small knowledge of the topic of feedback.     So far I was inexperienced in the other areas of the subject Introduction to Pedagogical Diagnostics.     The script asked me the possibility to get to know these other areas and thus to cope with the previous work phase in the best possible way.,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
148,The subject of Pedagogical Diagnostics is very interesting for me personally.     Couldn't really look forward to it and motivate me at the moment though because of the online semester  as I don't feel like I can absorb much learning content.     I only understood what exactly was required of me after reading through the question several times.     I liked it to reproduce the  for me  rather unclear slides in their own wording.     I could not concentrate so well during this  but this is due to the current situation.     The written task became clearer and clearer during the processing.     Independent learning does not suit me  as I lose my focus too quicklyI estimate my level of competence in this subject as satisfactory  as I have no real motivation for learning due to the online semester.     I personally find my solution to the written assignments good.     In my opinion  you could do without these three pages of reflection and shorten it to one detailed reflection.     The learning unit would have turned out very pleasant if there was no online semester and I myself was more motivated.,"[0, 0, 1, 1]"
149,Before I worked on this assignment  I first just read through the slides of the lecture and already noticed that I didn't understand everything  because I still lacked the details to many key points to be able to understand them.     Nevertheless  I looked at the task afterwards but quickly noticed  however  that I didn't really understand what I had to do.     After the little food for thought  I then at least knew which slides I needed to work on the task and also realized how I should approach the task.     However  the individual key points on the slide were not enough for me to work on the task  which is why I then watched the lecture recording first to understand what it was all about.     After that I was actually able to work on the task quite well.     Since I had not yet dealt with the topic of pedagogical diagnostics before I did the assignment  I did not know at the beginning what to expect in terms of content here.     While working on the task  however  it became clear to me what this is all about and also how important it is for my later profession.     In retrospect  I would say that I learned a lot through this task and also understood what I should pay attention to later in my lessons.     However  I don't know if I will be able to put this into practice because I am still completely lacking practice there.     However  I find that this and also the task on class management and dealing with disturbances have prepared me the most for the real everyday life of a teacher in my teacher training program so far.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
150,Ms. Klammer is bad at changing the given guidelines of the tasks to be asked  but she is better at explaining the procedure and the related evaluation criteria to the students.     In addition  with the help of feedback research  she could improve students' learning strategies and bring them additional motivation.     This can also be very well linked to the self-tests mentioned above.,"[1, 0, 0, 1]"
151,I proceeded as follows:     - On Monday in the week of the work assignment  I downloaded the lecture slides and read them carefully     - Afterwards I watched the lecture and took notes on the slides    - At the end I made a short summary with my own notes and the slides  which I could then use to work on the tasks (these have     to me     very     helped)-     I then started directly with the work phase to apply the learned content.     I find the learning content comprehensibly structured and easy to understand  which is why I find the topics very interesting.     I already knew individual topics/words in the individual lectures from the Psychology 1 module  which also helped me to understand the topics in the lectures.,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
152,The learning phase was good because both in the lecture and in the basic seminar the different dimensions of educational diagnostics were explained and presented in detail.     However  I would have liked to see more practical examples.     The whole topic  although on the whole well comprehensible  is very theoretical.     I would have been very interested  for example  in children's solutions to the example tests presented.     (Besides  there was a lot of text.)     I found the questions for self-control in the learning module of the basic seminar very good.     This allowed me to check what I understood or to reread what I answered incorrectly.     I found the work assignment understandable and easy to do.     I limited myself here to one aspect of educational diagnostics to answer the question.     I find it very good that the tasks are not about a knowledge query  but about understanding and transfer.     I also appreciate the practical application character of the tasks!,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
153,At first the topic sounded very complicated and foreign  until I noticed that I already knew a lot from the last semester in educational psychology and could therefore at least roughly already get an idea.     My first thoughts after reading the case study were: Ms. Klammer must know the performance level of more than just individual pupils  individual queries are not sufficient here.     Why do many not participate in the lessons?     Motivation problems?     How can these possibly be remedied?     Did Ms. Klammer really overestimate her class so much that the result was so bad?     By already knowing a lot from educational psychology  one could easily cope with most of the slides.     But then the actual transfer and application to a practical situation turned out to be a bit more difficult  because one had such a wide range of possible reasons  models  approaches and methods at one's disposal.     I am not one hundred percent satisfied  because although I thought I understood the contents well  I was able to apply them to the realistic situation rather moderately and had a hard time especially with the structuring and comprehensiveness.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
154,I had a lot of fun completing it at first  but the thought-provoking material takes or takes too much time to work out.     As an alternative  I find uniform grids for such tasks more useful.     I find educational diagnostics to be one of the most interesting topics in the SP course.     I don't know how well you can ride by on a transfer task if you only get food for thought or further tasks to consider little by little.     No  I wasn't always clear on the assignments.     I think it's great to help the teacher with diagnostics because at least in corona time it gives you a chance to apply your knowledge and doesn't just require query.     I worked on the task in stages and was accordingly freshly concentrated  in the process I unfortunately often lost the thread when I had to restart.     I have already answered this question in another upload.     If you have a study group  you can help each other to explain incomprehensible things to each other.     But in this Corona time without presence - meaning not seeing fellow students is very hard to be on your own  especially as a Ersti.     I have to read through this topic again and again because I have to prepare for other topics and courses  but I understood the core.     I think my solution/result is good.     I think I was able to address all the questions well and extensively.     I rate my overall learning unit as satisfactory based solely on the individual reference standard.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
155,Reflection before the work phase:     Regrettably  I approached this task with somewhat less motivation than in the first written task  since the subject matter did not particularly appeal to me and I had to struggle with minor comprehension difficulties.     assignment on the topic of introduction to     the pedagogical diagnosticsTherefore     I took another look at the most important parts of the recorded/scored lecture.     On the whole  it was clear to me what I should do  however  I was not quite clear how to best implement it.     Reflection during the work phase:     First  I took a closer look at all the lecture slides again and marked what seemed important to me.     After that  it was just a matter of putting the whole thing into a self-explanatory text  which turned out to be not so easy in some places.     But all in all I got along well with the task.     Reflection after the work phase:After working on the task  I definitely have the feeling that this task has given me the chance to gain a deeper understanding of pedagogical diagnostics and that I am now generally more familiar with the topic.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
156,Prior to working on the practice assignment  I made sure I had my materials on hand so that I could access them at appropriate points.     However  I found that I was able to navigate the topic Classroom Management better than the topic Educational Diagnostics.     During the editing process  I was therefore not yet so sure about the assignment and therefore definitely needed the little food for thought and the little content tip.     After the processing I would say that I have again dealt with the pedagogical diagnostics in more depth through the outlining and the case study.,"[1, 0, 1, 1]"
157,Before the learning unit I had a hard time to summarize the definitions and theoretical explanations of the topic.     After I have gone through the documents again carefully I have found it easier.     In general  I find the independent work on StudOn a bit difficult  because I can motivate myself alone without consultation rather sporadically.     However  I found the practical second sub-task particularly fun  where you could come up with a concept for future lesson planning.     All in all  I worked through the course unit thoroughly and understood the content.,"[0, 0, 1, 1]"
158,- Reflection on the situation before working through the subject matter:     Initially  I was excited about the task and willing to cope with it.     Reflection on the situation during the processing of the topic:     I looked at the given tips and tried to find out what exactly was required of me.     In doing so  I was often unsure whether I had too much or too little depth in my answers.-     Reflection on the situation after dealing with the subject matter:     I am relatively satisfied with my answers to the questions  even if a certain uncertainty remains as to whether the result is sufficient.     Nevertheless  I think it is good that these two topics should be answered in writing and consequently are not relevant to the exam.,"[1, 0, 1, 0]"
