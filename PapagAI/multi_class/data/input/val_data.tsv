155	Reflection before the work phase:     Regrettably  I approached this task with somewhat less motivation than in the first written task  since the subject matter did not particularly appeal to me and I had to struggle with minor comprehension difficulties.     assignment on the topic of introduction to     the pedagogical diagnosticsTherefore     I took another look at the most important parts of the recorded/scored lecture.     On the whole  it was clear to me what I should do  however  I was not quite clear how to best implement it.     Reflection during the work phase:     First  I took a closer look at all the lecture slides again and marked what seemed important to me.     After that  it was just a matter of putting the whole thing into a self-explanatory text  which turned out to be not so easy in some places.     But all in all I got along well with the task.     Reflection after the work phase:After working on the task  I definitely have the feeling that this task has given me the chance to gain a deeper understanding of pedagogical diagnostics and that I am now generally more familiar with the topic.

128	Not so motivated.     The topic is very interesting.     I read through the lecture and took notes on it.  At first it was hard for me to understand what exactly I should write down     but     with the help it worked out quite well.     I especially enjoyed putting myself in the teacher's shoes because it brought you closer to the practice.     During the working phase I was concentrated.     I managed quite well when working on the questions with the help of the assistance.     I didn't quite understand some of the topics  but I tried as hard as I could to answer the questions correctly.     I found the slides on the topic Introduction to Educational Diagnostics very understandable and helpful for working through the assignment.     I think I got a good overview of this topic.

95	Through the detailed occupation with the topic Introduction to Pedagogical Diagnostics  it first becomes really clear to you what you have to pay attention to in Pedagogical Diagnostics.     It is important to know what the subject means in the first place and to get to know the psychological basics  which give great insight into the subject.     Furthermore  it is important to deal with the quality criteria and to consider and reflect on them in every work.     Knowledge of errors in judgment can be uncovered during one's own reflection and avoided in further teaching and performance measurement.     In a further step  the change of time has to be considered  which is why formative and summative performance measurement through empirical findings and critiques of the previous procedure help to make performance measurement easier and more transparent for all involved.     The new feedback culture helps the teacher to know about the competencies of the students and encourages an exchange with the children to promote further learning.     In fact  in the end  it is important to apply the individual reference norm in order to be able to evaluate criterially at the end of a teaching unit in a class work.     In conclusion  although pedagogical diagnostics is only one of many subject areas in school pedagogy  it is highly relevant to the teaching profession later in life.	[1, 0, 1, 1]
55	I approached it with less motivation because the online semester gives me some difficulties.     Being involved in youth work  I was generally interested in the subject matter.     Despite lack of preparation  it was easy to understand what was required.     Concentration was hard to find with the rather low motivation.     However  I was able to play good practical examples for the case study in my head due to my volunteer work.     After refreshing the slides  the processing was doable.     By refreshing the learning units and connecting them with my practical experience in social work  I assume to have understood the topic of class management and dealing with disturbances well.     I consider my solution to be appropriate.     I personally feel that the reflection took too much time than it should have.	[0, 0, 1, 0]
18	Before the work phase  I approached the task with motivation and made a plan of what materials I would need to answer the questions.     What interested me most in the topic was the prevention of disorder (here especially Kounin's perspective in the ecological approach)  but also what participatory possibilities there are for students (e.g. the class council).     The first task was clearly and unambiguously formulated  but with the second I was unsure whether a short-term (What do I do shortly after the wet blackboard sponge lands in my face?) or a long-term reaction was called for.     For the most part  the processing phase was concentrated  the assistance was helpful  and I basically got along quite well with both tasks.     In general  it was an interesting different experience to work with the assignments in the more open-ended format and in my opinion  the motivation to engage with the literature and work through it was higher.  I think my skill level has     improved     improved           mainly because of the relatively practical application situation  which indirectly tries to show you different problem areas to pay attention to in the teaching profession (e.g. pay attention to students' needs)     Overall  I am satisfied with my solution to the written assignment and would describe my learning progress in this area as profitable.

56	I read through the case study carefully and marked the key terms or crucial words.     Based on prior knowledge from previous lectures and my own experience from school and internships  I already had a rough intuitive idea of how to handle the situation.     However  of course  without having the necessary technical terminology.     My first impressions/thoughts were: Why does the behavior of the students change so suddenly?     What are the possible causes?     Do these lie only with the students or also with the teacher?     Could the behavior have been prevented and if so  how?     What consequences must be drawn?     However  I found it somewhat difficult at first to structure the analysis and the answer to the question precisely.     During the processing of the material  more and more parts fitted into my previously assumed hypothesis or my posed questions.     With the help of the definitions and explanations I was now able to justify my assumptions and better work out possible solutions.     The action matrix according to Becker also provided a good structure for the procedure.     The assignment confused me at first  but after reading the thought-provoking text  the division into analysis  i.e. prevention  and reaction  i.e. intervention  was logical and understandable.     The learning unit showed me that quite a few of my approaches were already intuitively going in the right direction.     However  it has helped me to bundle  structure and supplement my previous knowledge.     The learning result of this unit feels somewhat better consolidated and understood than that of the previous one  since I was able to deal with the contents more intensively and also more practically through the case study.     On the whole  I am satisfied with my result.	[1, 0, 1, 1]
12	I did not understand the question at first.     After my inquiry was answered very competently by Mrs. Weigand  the processing was not difficult for me  because the literature and already self-made experiences describe and let analyze the case very detailed.     A more concrete question would have been very helpful to me to possibly intensify learning phases such as teaching behavior  preparation or follow-up or prevention of a conflict to describe or present.	[0, 0, 1, 1]
96	I tried to put myself in the position to see how I would act.     Not satisfied  I need to look at the part more closely to take more from it.	[1, 0, 0, 1]
76	It is not enough to question individual students to determine their level of knowledge  it is important to maintain communication in class and to ask students specific questions without the pressure of a grade to get the best possible knowledge about the individual level of knowledge.     It is also advisable in advance of a test to observe individual students over a longer period of time and then evaluate them on the basis of their individual performance and improvement.     It can be advantageous to discuss the learning objectives with students in advance  so they know exactly what to expect.	[0, 0, 0, 1]
151	I proceeded as follows:     - On Monday in the week of the work assignment  I downloaded the lecture slides and read them carefully     - Afterwards I watched the lecture and took notes on the slides    - At the end I made a short summary with my own notes and the slides  which I could then use to work on the tasks (these have     to me     very     helped)-     I then started directly with the work phase to apply the learned content.     I find the learning content comprehensibly structured and easy to understand  which is why I find the topics very interesting.     I already knew individual topics/words in the individual lectures from the Psychology 1 module  which also helped me to understand the topics in the lectures.	[1, 0, 1, 0]
51	Before I worked on the assignment  I worked on the slides on Class Management and thus had a rough overview of the topic.     I took some time to find a solution and appropriate reaction for the incident that made sense to me from an educational point of view  as I found it difficult to come up with an appropriate situation at first.     After thinking longer it was easy for me to develop the idea further and move on to an appropriate response.     I find the topic very interesting and feel it is very important for today's teaching profession  which is why I was motivated to solve the task.     I think that my approach to solving the problem is useful but definitely has room for improvement.     I enjoyed thinking about a challenging situation in everyday school life and I think it is very useful to work on such scenarios already in theory and to think about it.     I felt prepared because of the given slides which I worked on beforehand.	[1, 0, 1, 0]
19	[     Well  I knew that the assignment was a necessary requirement for writing the exam.     So my motivation was solely to complete it in order to be admitted to the exam.     How to deal with disturbances I find interesting  but apart from the very practical text by Lohmann and some passages by Becker  I did not have the impression that the literature would have helped me in a real conflict situation  since the suggestions for action described in it were  in my opinion are formulated too little concretely and too abstractly  or also simply not realizable  since for it probably not at all sufficient time would be available in instruction and I can well imagine that some of the recommendations for action  in particular from young and older Sus would not be taken seriously  because they are simply too lax...     ][In editing  the only thing that was actually fun was reading the Lohmann text.     I found this one the most practical  since it dispenses with useless theoretical and scientific generalizations and formalities and is comparatively direct and concrete in its analysis of disorders as well as possible interventions.     Overall  I got along well using the references in processing the work assignment  however  it lowered my motivation and concentration to repeatedly search in several  mostly very theoretical and general texts for the few usable passages for the practical solution of the conflict situation.     I found the work instructions  without having read the literature beforehand  to be much too vague.     Likewise the case study  since it contains too few concrete clues to possible mistakes of the teacher or disturbing motives of the students and thus many approaches to the solution must aim strongly into the speculative.  Without having read all the processing notes  I would not have known what was required of me in writing the assignment and reflection.     Since I had no time pressure to complete the lecture slides on a weekly basis  I was able to use the time for other courses  which allowed me to manage my time more flexibly.     However  without live lectures  I also had no real motivation to read  summarize  or learn from the lecture notes on my own on a regular basis.[I     still don't feel like I am really competent in the field after the unit.     While I can imagine having a basic tool and some guidance for practice at hand after working through the Lohmann text and Beck's excerpt in detail  I do not believe that one can actually speak of acquired competence after reading the texts without having tried out the interventions described in them in practice.     I probably could have included more dialogic interventions in my solution.     However  I saw no real reason to do so  based on the less than informative case study.     Depending on the grade level  level of insight  and basic attitude of the class  more or less time could also be spent on jointly creating rules of behavior in the classroom and lessons.     Honestly  I am a bit annoyed by all the meta-questions  which makes it difficult for me to reflect neutrally on my reflection.     Really haven't gotten much out of the unit so far.     However  I plan to take a closer look at the material on this once the exams are over and I can give the topic another chance in peace afterwards.	[1, 1, 1, 1]
24	I find the subject area very interesting because it can often be difficult to resolve conflicts.     Due to the fact that everyone approaches conflicts differently  you can also write a lot here accordingly.     At first  however  it was not clear to me how exactly to approach this assignment.     I then read through some tips on the website and oriented myself to these.     I started with the definition and then made pretty good progress.     I mainly stuck to the lecture slides  because I find them easier than long texts.     I got along well with the learning contents and I tried to explain them as well as I could.     I had some problems with the structure and was not sure how detailed these topics should be written out.     Another problem for me was the example.     You didn't get very much information about how the teacher dealt with the class  which meant you had to speculate more often and include many different aspects which might be problematic.     Nevertheless  I thought it was good that one could write relatively much on the subject.     I am satisfied with my result  because I dealt with the topic for a long time and I enjoyed being able to make a written connection between theory and practice.     This also helped me in memorizing the theoretical aspects and I think that now I am much more familiar with this topic.     I think the second workload will be a little easier for me now that I know roughly what to expect.	[1, 0, 1, 0]
145	Honestly  I was a bit unsure about the first question and I also don't know if that was required of me as well.     So to structure the content better  I created a table.     This table has also helped me in understanding the content  because I had to think a few times and look up whether this can now be so true.     I'm not completely satisfied with my result in the first task  because I also don't know if it's true that way.     I could work on the second task more easily and I think my result in this task is good.	[1, 0, 1, 0]
16	I approached the task very motivated  because the topic in general interests me very much  because disturbances and conflicts are unavoidable and of course as a teacher I would like to act correctly in such situations and keep them as low as possible through prevention.     Moreover  this topic has a very great practical relevance which only motivates me even more.     To prepare for the task  I went through the set of slides on this topic again and looked at which slides I could use for answering with regard to the question.     This gave me a rough overview and then I was able to start working on it relatively quickly.     I had a hard time with the case study  because it was very general and a lot of information was missing  which I more or less thought of or interpreted myself afterwards.     That's why I was then also somewhat unsettled  because I did not know exactly whether that was the intention or not.     Moreover  I also didn't know exactly how deep I should go into the case study or simply add it as an example for explanation.     During the processing I also read some suggested texts  which I liked very much because they explained many terms and methods again and showed and clarified them with practical examples.     With the entire task I get along relatively well  I like it quite well that I can make myself more or less a schedule as I work on the topic and can then also go through it at my pace.     I have the feeling that I know the subject area very well because I have read a lot in the literature and my interest is also very high.     I think my solution to the written assignment is good although I had a hard time especially with the case study and I also tried to work on it as far as possible without assistance.     In addition  the horizon of expectations is unclear to me to what extent we should go into depth in this processing.	[1, 0, 1, 0]
147	A psychology lecture already provided me with some knowledge in the area of validity  judgment error  and objectivity.     Thanks to participation in the block seminar on school pedagogy at the beginning of the semester and a didactics lecture  I already possessed a small knowledge of the topic of feedback.     So far I was inexperienced in the other areas of the subject Introduction to Pedagogical Diagnostics.     The script asked me the possibility to get to know these other areas and thus to cope with the previous work phase in the best possible way.	[1, 0, 1, 0]
