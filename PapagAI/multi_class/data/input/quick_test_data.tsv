152	The learning phase was good because both in the lecture and in the basic seminar the different dimensions of educational diagnostics were explained and presented in detail.     However  I would have liked to see more practical examples.     The whole topic  although on the whole well comprehensible  is very theoretical.     I would have been very interested  for example  in children's solutions to the example tests presented.     (Besides  there was a lot of text.)     I found the questions for self-control in the learning module of the basic seminar very good.     This allowed me to check what I understood or to reread what I answered incorrectly.     I found the work assignment understandable and easy to do.     I limited myself here to one aspect of educational diagnostics to answer the question.     I find it very good that the tasks are not about a knowledge query  but about understanding and transfer.     I also appreciate the practical application character of the tasks!	[1, 0, 1, 1]
30	Very motivated  as I felt I understood3 the topic.     It interests me because one is confronted with it more often in the teaching profession.     However  I think that you can not always act according to learned  but also act from the gut in a situation.     Nevertheless  the module can give you incentive to think about your actions in the future and whether you want to take the theory to heart or not.     Actually good.     Yep.     Since the same assignment keeps coming up  I'm a little confused as to whether it fits now.     Since I was sure from the beginning that I had done everything  the same worksheet in task 0 and 1 confused me a lot.     With this learning unit very well.     As I said  I hope good.     I find the constant asking how I got on with it a bit annoying  since I can't say for sure.     As I said  I think I got it.     But I don't know  of course  whether you see it exactly that way.     For this reason  I can only answer the question from my point of view and not from the point of view of the fact!!!     Is all right.     To see the Prof. times personally  would be really not bad.     It feels as if nothing comes from the Prof pages.     In itself I like editing alone  but as a freshman somewhat unsuitable  because you have to find your way with it first.     A better briefing would be already helpful there.     Basically I find the module good  but the questions give me again the feeling that the professor did not want to make much work and therefore designed everything asynchronously.     More targeted  varied questions would be great.     Also a better introduction to the whole lecture.     Also the accompanying seminar was not so well designed  as I was for example in the crash course which in retrospect was not really helpful  as we had to work on everything without even having seen the VL before and the time was also much too short.     Solutions were expected and I was not able to work on them to my satisfaction in that short amount of time because I could not read into the subject matter that quickly.	[1, 0, 1, 1]
