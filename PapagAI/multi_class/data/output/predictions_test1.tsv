152	The learning phase was good because both in the lecture and in the basic seminar the different dimensions of educational diagnostics were explained and presented in detail.     However  I would have liked to see more practical examples.     The whole topic  although on the whole well comprehensible  is very theoretical.     I would have been very interested  for example  in children's solutions to the example tests presented.     (Besides  there was a lot of text.)     I found the questions for self-control in the learning module of the basic seminar very good.     This allowed me to check what I understood or to reread what I answered incorrectly.     I found the work assignment understandable and easy to do.     I limited myself here to one aspect of educational diagnostics to answer the question.     I find it very good that the tasks are not about a knowledge query  but about understanding and transfer.     I also appreciate the practical application character of the tasks!

30	Very motivated  as I felt I understood3 the topic.     It interests me because one is confronted with it more often in the teaching profession.     However  I think that you can not always act according to learned  but also act from the gut in a situation.     Nevertheless  the module can give you incentive to think about your actions in the future and whether you want to take the theory to heart or not.     Actually good.     Yep.     Since the same assignment keeps coming up  I'm a little confused as to whether it fits now.     Since I was sure from the beginning that I had done everything  the same worksheet in task 0 and 1 confused me a lot.     With this learning unit very well.     As I said  I hope good.     I find the constant asking how I got on with it a bit annoying  since I can't say for sure.     As I said  I think I got it.     But I don't know  of course  whether you see it exactly that way.     For this reason  I can only answer the question from my point of view and not from the point of view of the fact!!!     Is all right.     To see the Prof. times personally  would be really not bad.     It feels as if nothing comes from the Prof pages.     In itself I like editing alone  but as a freshman somewhat unsuitable  because you have to find your way with it first.     A better briefing would be already helpful there.     Basically I find the module good  but the questions give me again the feeling that the professor did not want to make much work and therefore designed everything asynchronously.     More targeted  varied questions would be great.     Also a better introduction to the whole lecture.     Also the accompanying seminar was not so well designed  as I was for example in the crash course which in retrospect was not really helpful  as we had to work on everything without even having seen the VL before and the time was also much too short.     Solutions were expected and I was not able to work on them to my satisfaction in that short amount of time because I could not read into the subject matter that quickly.	[1, 0, 1, 1]	[0, 1, 1, 1]
31	Before working on the topic of class management and dealing with disturbances  I might have acted more quickly and impulsively by copying the behavior of my former teachers.     On the other hand  I have already thought a lot about it and thought about it before the topic.     Therefore it came also to no gigantic surprises.     At the beginning it was difficult for me the task.     Mainly for the reason that there were no concrete ideas about it  e.g.     How detailed should the analysis be.     How exactly should I present my reaction.     How detailed should the reflection be.     Etc.     However  when starting the task I noticed that you quickly get into a writing flow and I kept this result of writing flow.     Of course one could go for example with the analysis very much more into the detail  only that again rum I find in this context of the spontaneous reaction Not appropriate.     Furthermore  there had been certain organizational difficulties makes it a difference whether I use the assistance or not.     Wen I in the learning sequence simply click on continue get I the assistance automatically?     And is that then saved?     etc.     I still find this kind of exercise very good and I think that you should definitely keep it because you learn to act better so preventively.     Nevertheless  I can imagine that especially in this situation the difference between written elaboration and the real situation is very strong  in the written task I can plan and think about my actions neutrally  in the class much additional factors such as emotions play with a role.     As a result  it can quickly happen that one acts more impulsively than would be good  up to a certain point I think that is also ok.     I find it is however straight therefore important after one acted to consider  why and why one acted likewise.	[1, 0, 1, 1]	[1, 1, 1, 1]
101	I first looked at the assignment to get a rough overview of the topic.     After that I watched the recording of the lecture from 2015 and worked through the uploaded PowerPoint presentation.     After that  I took notes on what to write in the assignments.     While editing  I worked closely with the recording and Leutner's text.     I tried to structure my thoughts and also incorporate personal procedures.     I am satisfied with my learning outcome and find I have     the     subject matter     understood	[1, 0, 1, 0]	[1, 0, 0, 0]
98	I found it very difficult to find an answer at first  what is meant by structuring pedagogical diagnostics.     I found the assignment itself again too general and would have liked a more concrete example.     However  the help was very purposeful this time.     In general  I found it difficult to bring in technical terms or expertise here again  although I succeeded much better this time.	[0, 0, 1, 1]	[1, 1, 1, 0]
141	I am very interested in the topic  however  it has been very extensive.     It took me a lot of time to go through and understand all the slides.     Nevertheless  I found working on the task very exciting.     Because such a scenario can happen to any teacher in their future professional life.     By intensively dealing with the topic  I have a much greater understanding in the future.     At the beginning  I had a little difficulty with the topic and had to read up longer.     Especially because there were so many slides on it.     Overall  I found working on this assignment more difficult than working on the first assignment.     I intensively studied this topic thanks to working on the task.     It is a very complex subject and this elaboration of the situation makes it easier to understand.     As with the last time I worked on the assignment  I think that by working intensively and doing research  one will have more in mind in the future than by just memorizing for the exam.	[1, 0, 1, 1]	[0, 1, 1, 1]
135	As in the other exercise  I tried to go through the exercise objectively.     This time I had more respect for the exercise since the learning content was bigger.     This time my motivation was much lower  because the topic does not appeal to me so much and as already mentioned it was significantly more material.     I felt reasonably well prepared for the task  but it was still difficult to understand.     I didn't get along so well with the learning content this time because it was significantly more and it wasn't structured well enough for me.     The first part of the task was relatively difficult for me because I didn't know what to do at the beginning.     The second part was much more pleasant to work on.     I enjoyed the second part a lot as it was again reality based.     I had a hard time with the first part of the assignment  which is due to the large area that the assignment covers.     I found the whole unit a bit harder  however it is definitely achievable.     I am not so at peace with my learning result this time  because I still can't imagine everything.     With the written task I worked on the second part well     However  in my opinion  I have gaps in the first.     I consider my level of competence to be okay.     I can definitely improve in this area.     I solved the second part well  which unfortunately I cannot say about the first part.     My reflection is again relatively detailed and shows me myself that I still have weaknesses in this area.     I consider my entire learning unit as sufficient  because as I said I can still improve.	[1, 0, 1, 1]	[1, 1, 1, 1]
125	I personally found the learning and working phase on the topic of pedagogical diagnostics to be a bit more demanding than the one on the first topic  but this may possibly also be due to the scope of the lecture.     In addition  I was able to work on the topic on teaching disruption better and easier in the questions  because it was closer to what one has experienced so personally in one's own school days.     For both topics  I proceeded in such a way that I first worked through the lecture/s and then made my own notes.     I then referred back to these when working on the topics.	[1, 0, 1, 0]	[1, 1, 0, 0]
15	For the reflection of my work steps it is to be mentioned that I looked at the lecture slides and the literature mentioned in preparation and could dedicate myself thus well informed to the example.     The topic is very interesting for me  because I can well imagine a situation as described in the example.     If I had gone to class with the little knowledge I had before working on this topic  I would have been very helpless in the situation mentioned.     In this respect  dealing with the content has helped me in every way.     During the processing  my concentration was well present  which is why I was able to process the task in a well-structured manner.     Among other things  I oriented myself to the help on StudOn  as this made the common thread clearer to me.     Overall  I find working independently with available literature good  but motivating myself is usually a challenge.     After working on the assignment  I now feel better prepared to face conflicts especially in a class  or to act preventively in advance.     In my opinion  I succeeded well in working out the task and I was also able to reflect in a good way.     Overall  I consider the learning unit to have been successfully worked on.	[0, 0, 1, 1]	[1, 1, 1, 1]
78	I find the subject matter very exciting and useful.     The lecture was good to follow and more practical than the other lectures  Also I think it is good to get tasks to the individual lectures and work on them so.     It helps me to remember topics better.     The editing went well.     However  I would have liked to have had an approximate scope guideline.     Since I didn't know if I wrote too little.     In conclusion  I find that the assignment helped me a lot to understand the lecture and also to apply it.	[0, 0, 1, 1]	[0, 1, 1, 1]
94	I consider the topic very significant and therefore approached it with interest.     Through individual texts  the lecture videos and lecture slides I felt well prepared.     The assignment was also well understood.     Due to the fact that I have already worked on a  at least formally  similar assignment (on topic area 4)  I got along well with the entire assignment and the independent learning on StudOn.     Furthermore  the basic seminar Zoom sessions helped me.     In addition  I consider reflections very helpful and important to be informed about the state of one's competence.     While working on the task I was focused and found especially the 2nd part of the task exciting.     Fun       therefore  I especially enjoyed analyzing the situation described and figuring out the possibilities to help Ms. Klammer.     I think that I have a very good overview of the topic Introduction to Pedagogical Diagnostics and therefore I can also give a proper solution to the written task.     The learning unit was understandable and there is nothing that seemed incomprehensible to me.	[0, 1, 1, 0]	[0, 1, 1, 0]
126	For the topic Introduction to Pedagogical Diagnostics  I proceeded as follows:     First  I looked at the previous semesters' notes and made notes on the uploaded files.     Afterwards  I went through them again and then created an individual summary for myself  which I have now worked with in order to get an overview more quickly.     Reflecting on this method  I have to say frankly that I have been working this way for quite some time and am very satisfied.     I have found out for me that it is not so important to hear or read the lecture  but the most effective step is actually writing down myself  since I am thereby forced to bring my own structure into the subject and me so  connections become clearer.	[1, 0, 1, 0]	[1, 1, 1, 1]
29	I considered this part of the module very important and exciting  which is why my motivation was very high.     Through my volunteer activities I already know such situations  but I cannot solve them in the classroom as I do in sports (e.g.  doing push-ups or running).     In terms of content  I was hoping for tips and solutions on how to get a handle on difficult classes.     Through my orientation internship  in which I was already allowed to teach complete classes on my own  I have already had my first experiences with challenging classes.     For me it was therefore very exciting to check whether my reactions and actions were correct.     I found it exciting during the processing that I actually witnessed a similar situation as a student.     During the processing I questioned my teacher's reaction and thought about how he could have reacted better.     In fact  I came to the conclusion that because of my classmates  the teacher could not have reacted better.     In principle  I enjoyed working on the assignments  even though I find the presentation unfortunate.     In general  I got along very well.     I find the independent elaboration of the learning contents on Studon pleasant and easy.     I feel well able to deal with disturbances in class.     The contents of the theoretical unit also confirm me in my reaction to previously experienced situations.     I consider my solution of the written task to be complete  as I have brought in a mixture of theoretical content and personal feeling.     I find the learning unit useful and well presented.     In my personal opinion  however  one can only gain confidence in dealing with disruptions in the classroom through experience and implementation of the theoretical content.	[1, 0, 1, 1]	[1, 1, 1, 1]
65	Before working on the task  I felt increasingly uncertain  especially with regard to my challenge in the first task  but again generally well prepared  since I had already looked at and worked through the lecture slides set to music  the scripts from the basic seminar and the lecture  and had read into the literature given.     This was again my first approach: Gather information and pre-inform as best I could on the subject matter  or provide understanding and an overview.     The contents were thereby prepared for me very understandably.     The second step was then an understanding of the work order and which form this elaboration should take.     I found the learning contents during the processing to be informative and logically very well comprehensible as well as practical.     The written assignment clearly asked for a short sketch of the topic area and subsequent observation as well as supplementary ideas and clearly marked out and narrowed down the task for me.     This gave me back much of the confidence I lacked prior to the assignment.     However  the openness to the form  scope  and structure that the processing of this task should encompass remained a factor of uncertainty for me.     Does the processing carry more of an examination task character or does it go more in the direction of homework in terms of processing.     This is reflected  as in the processing of the first task also in my elaboration.     I am very satisfied with my learning result with this learning unit  as with the first task.     I have discovered some new and action-guiding things for the design of lessons or the design of performance measurement of students for later practice and  in particular  I have also strengthened the theoretical knowledge on the legitimacy of the assessment and evaluation of performance as well as the theoretical knowledge on the further development of performance assessment processes.     The differentiating dimensions of diagnostics (Leutner 2001) were very memorable in this process and feel like good preparation for planning and applying diagnostics in later practice.     I am satisfied with the result of my written assignment  even though a residual uncertainty remains as to whether the assignment was answered appropriately and correctly in terms of content  form  and scope.     From my point of view  I addressed all points of the assignment and was able to draw some conclusions and options for action that were informative for me from the processing of the case study.	[1, 1, 1, 0]	[1, 1, 1, 1]
60	The assignment on the topic of introduction to pedagogical diagnostics is good to work on.     However  I found it difficult to refer to the theory and to refer to the diagnostic instruments during the application.	[0, 0, 1, 0]	[1, 0, 1, 0]
9	I found the task very interesting and well chosen.     I took a block seminar with Ms. Truckenbrodt this semester on appreciative communication and dealing with difficult parents and students.     From there  I was able to quickly find my way into the topic.     I was just a little confused at first by the different submission forms and wasn't sure if I should submit one document or five now  but I was able to figure that out.     It was relatively difficult for me to read through the lecture slides  I took several breaks and then had to look at unclear content in the lecture recording again.     However  I generally find it quite difficult to work through content independently.     I have a hard time concentrating on video recordings and often digress when reading pdfs and have to start over.     Therefore  I need a lot of breaks.     The written task didn't seem particularly difficult to me now  I was able to write it quite quickly.     However  I am not quite sure if I completed the task as it was intended.     I think that I was already forced by the task to deal with the subject contents more intensively than I usually do.     Besides  the topic interested me.     Therefore  I already think that I have taken a lot with me here.     I hope that I have done the task well and properly in itself.     But I have a generally positive feeling.
