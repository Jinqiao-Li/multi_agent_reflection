"Sticking to a daily commitment, even a small one, was a bit challenging at times. It’s easy to let small tasks slip or get distracted by other priorities, especially when life feels busy. However, I found that when I set a clear intention for the day, it helped me stay focused on my goals.

The challenge was balancing consistency with flexibility. Some days, I had to adjust my commitments due to unexpected events, but overall, I realized that keeping even small promises to myself helps build a sense of accomplishment and trust. It’s a reminder of the importance of aligning my actions with my values and goals, no matter how small the task."	[1, 1, 1, 1]

Lebenslanges Lernen ist immer eine Challenge die immer anders ist und uns immer anders fordert. Es benötigt die ständige Weiterentwicklung unseres Wissens und unserer Fähigkeiten, um uns an die sich ständig verändernden Anforderungen des Lebens anzupassen. Lebenslanges Leben ist für mich eine sehr wichtige persönliche Grundeinstellung und wird durch den sozialen Kontakt gefördert.	[0, 1, 1, 0]

When the company is satisfied with the product we delivered and project collaboration was smooth and efficient. The goals set at the beginning were completed as requested and my group will receive a grade that reflects this process. Additionally, I know it will have been a personal success if I have been able to finish the capstone project without any of my previously stated concerns turning true.	[1, 0, 1, 1]
"1. Listen Actively and Seek Clarification
Understand the Argument: Begin by fully listening to what the teacher or classmate is saying. Ensure you grasp their main points, evidence, and reasoning. Asking clarifying questions helps ensure that you’ve accurately understood their viewpoint.

Identify Key Claims: Break down their viewpoint into specific claims or statements, as it’s easier to assess each part individually rather than as a broad opinion.

2. Check for Evidence
Look for Supporting Facts: Evaluate if the person provides evidence for their statements. Reliable viewpoints are often backed by data, references, or examples.
Compare with Other Sources: If the viewpoint involves factual information, compare it with other credible sources, such as textbooks, reputable websites, or academic articles. Seeing if others with expertise agree or disagree can reveal how widely accepted or disputed the viewpoint is.

3. Analyze Logical Coherence
Examine the Reasoning: Consider whether the argument is logically sound. Are there gaps in reasoning, assumptions that aren’t supported, or conclusions that don’t logically follow from the evidence?
Spot Logical Fallacies: Look for any common logical fallacies, such as overgeneralizations, false dilemmas, or ad hominem attacks. These often weaken an argument and signal a need for further examination.

4. Assess for Bias or Perspective
Understand Their Perspective: Evaluate the potential bias of the person presenting the viewpoint. Bias doesn’t necessarily make an argument invalid, but it can shape the presentation or emphasis of certain information.
Consider Alternative Viewpoints: Compare the viewpoint with other perspectives. If a teacher or classmate’s opinion is just one of many, it’s valuable to consider other angles and see where they might diverge or overlap.

5. Test Applicability and Relevance
Consider Context: Is the viewpoint relevant and applicable to the topic or context? Sometimes viewpoints, while valid in a specific scenario, might not apply universally.
Practical Implications: If the viewpoint involves advice or recommendations, think about whether following it would lead to positive outcomes in practice. Practical experience can often shed light on the feasibility of a theoretical perspective."	[1, 0, 1, 0]
Looking at my personal learning goals, I’ve definitely made progress. I’ve become better at managing my time, setting clear priorities, and staying focused on what matters most. I've also gained a deeper understanding of my strengths and areas for growth, which has helped me approach challenges with more confidence. Some of my goals have shifted as I’ve learned more about what works for me, especially in terms of staying consistent and reflecting on my progress. Moving forward, I’d like to keep focusing on time management and self-regulation but would also add more emphasis on balancing work with self-care. I think finding that balance will be key to maintaining long-term growth.	[1, 0, 1, 1]
ik heb mijn planning wat uitgesteld, maar ik heb wel gedaan wat ik moest en wilde doen. Het was best raar dat we ineens woensdag vrij waren, ik snap de reden hiervoor ook nog steeds niet, maar het haalt me uit mijn ritme als ik ineens de hele week vrij heb als het ware.	[1, 1, 1, 0]

During the recent group work it was not always easy to work effectively together as some people were more motivated than other. The expectations towards our grades are also in different. Due to this the workload is not divided equally. Still the group work is very nice and I enjoy working with my group. We are having good ideas and our plan to improve st Gallen is very well analysed.

Activities like sports and meeting up with friends usually give me energy, as well as sometimes taking the time to relax, while things like not being able to have a moment for myself sometimes drain my energy. To have more energy I need to find moments to unwind, usually in some form of sporting or reading.	[0, 1, 1, 1]

Ich habe zu erst die Maße von meinem alten Montageständer gemessen und diese dann mit anderen Montageständern verglichen. Dann habe ich in der Werkstatt nach passenden Materialien geschaut, die für die Umsetzung in Frage kommen würden. Das nötige Wissen übers Schweißen habe ich in einer Metallwerkstatt erlangt. Außerdem habe ich im Internet verschiedene Informationen recherchiert und bei Unklarheiten den Fachlehrer befragt.	[1, 0, 1, 0]

I would ask questions that encourage them to consider their values and motivations, such as:

- “What aspects of this challenge resonate most with your personal goals or values?”
- “What would success in this area look like for you, and how would it change things?”
