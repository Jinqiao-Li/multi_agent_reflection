It should not include judgments, interpretations, or plans for the future. Avoid phrases like ‘because,’ ‘as a result,’ or ‘therefore,’ which indicate reasoning. Do not mention improvements or future plans.",

Typically includes emotional words (e.g., ‘excited,’ ‘frustrated,’ ‘confident’) and aspects of self-esteem. Focuses purely on internal emotions or motivation, without discussing performance, reasoning, or future actions. Avoid performance-related judgments (e.g., ‘I did well,’ ‘I struggled with’) or explanations for emotions.",

This includes recognizing strengths/weaknesses, drawing comparisons, justifying reasons, and discussing cause-effect relationships. Look for words like ‘because,’ ‘due to,’ ‘therefore,’ ‘as a result,’ or references to theories and justifications. This category should not include emotions (which belong in Feelings) or future action plans (which belong in Conclusion/Action Plan).",

This includes key lessons learned, decisions for future actions, goals, next steps, or strategy adaptations. Words like ‘finally,’ ‘in conclusion,’ or ‘moving forward’ are indicators. Must involve a resolution or actionable learning rather than just evaluation. Avoid detailed reasoning (which belongs in Evaluation/Analysis) and emotions (which belong in Feelings)."}

Avoids deep reflection on causes, theoretical explanations, or future improvements.",

Involves structured reasoning, identifying underlying causes, and making connections between concepts.

Does not focus on next steps or personal feelings but rather on explaining the reasoning behind events.",

Includes specific strategies, career applications, or learning extensions in internships, practicum, or self-directed study.

Include self-reflection on performance",
