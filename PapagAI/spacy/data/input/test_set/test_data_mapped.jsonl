{"text": " After that  I took notes on what to write in the assignments. ", "answer": "Description"}
{"text": " After I worked through the lectures  I additionally read up on the subject with further literature and looked up some terms on the Internet. ", "answer": "Description"}
{"text": " Of course  a student may have a bad day  or for various reasons may not perform as well as he/she would have been able to. ", "answer": "Description"}

{"text": " So I am quite satisfied with this one. ", "answer": "Feelings"}
{"text": " I am both satisfied and dissatisfied with the outcome of my written assignment. ", "answer": "Feelings"}
{"text": " I approached the task neutrally and openly and felt quite comfortable. ", "answer": "Feelings"}
{"text": " Quite satisfied  it is a very important subject area to take to heart as a teacher and has an important role in professional life. ", "answer": "Feelings"}
{"text": " Not so motivated. ", "answer": "Feelings"}
{"text": " So I am satisfied. ", "answer": "Feelings"}
{"text": " I was just a little confused at first by the different submission forms and wasn't sure if I should submit one document or five now  but I was able to figure that out. ", "answer": "Feelings"}
{"text": " Therefore  I have already thought a lot about the subject area in advance  but was only partially satisfied with my findings. ", "answer": "Feelings"}
{"text": " to be able to-I was pleased to learn something more ", "answer": "Feelings"}
{"text": " a good 7 - ", "answer": "Evaluation"}
{"text": " As an alternative  I find uniform grids for such tasks more useful. ", "answer": "Evaluation"}
{"text": " I am honest  I never know exactly what to write and how much to go in depth (but I answered them conscientiously)- ", "answer": "Evaluation"}
{"text": " I had trouble figuring out exactly how to approach it and I still doubt now if I worked it correctly. ", "answer": "Evaluation"}
{"text": " I don't know how well you can ride by on a transfer task if you only get food for thought or further tasks to consider little by little. ", "answer": "Evaluation"}
{"text": " In my personal opinion  however  one can only gain confidence in dealing with disruptions in the classroom through experience and implementation of the theoretical content.\" ", "answer": "Evaluation"}
{"text": " I just don't know how exactly one would react in the real situation. ", "answer": "Evaluation"}
{"text": " However  I found the practical second sub-task particularly fun  where you could come up with a concept for future lesson planning. ", "answer": "Evaluation"}
{"text": " I did not look at the tips on StudOn in this regard  but I still think that I was able to complete the task well. ", "answer": "Evaluation"}
{"text": " I did well with the task. ", "answer": "Evaluation"}
{"text": " I thought it was good that you could work with a concrete case study and thus establish a practical reference when working on the task - ", "answer": "Analysis"}
{"text": " Through the set of slides and the literature that was listed with  I felt well prepared to work on this task. ", "answer": "Analysis"}
{"text": " Before working on the task I was very motivated to deal with the topic of pedagogical diagnostics because I understand it as an essential part of the teaching profession in the assessment of students' performance. ", "answer": "Analysis"}
{"text": " I can't really judge whether I answered the task fully  it may well be that you can go into more detail and give even more examples in the second part of the task. ", "answer": "Analysis"}
{"text": " With such I often confuse myself  since I store both associations. ", "answer": "Analysis"}
{"text": " I could not concentrate so well during this  but this is due to the current situation. ", "answer": "Analysis"}
{"text": " However  this way of connecting a topic concretely with the facts only when I have a reliable source (helpful for exams) makes it difficult for me sometimes to ask questions at the beginning of the topic. ", "answer": "Analysis"}
{"text": " I approached the task optimistically  since much was already very clear to me through the basic seminar. ", "answer": "Analysis"}
{"text": " Without the help I would not have understood especially the first part question. ", "answer": "Analysis"}
{"text": " But by reading up on the literature and the examples explained in detail in it  I got a good impression of the topic. ", "answer": "Analysis"}
{"text": " In general  I noticed here that I enjoyed applying something more than reproducing it. ", "answer": "Conclusion"}
{"text": " Overall  I find working independently with available literature good  but motivating myself is usually a challenge. ", "answer": "Conclusion"}
{"text": " I think that my homework is not the best  however  I have made an effort here to make good progress. ", "answer": "Conclusion"}
{"text": " In conclusion  I find that the assignment helped me a lot to understand the lecture and also to apply it. ", "answer": "Conclusion"}
{"text": " This made it much easier for me to understand the models and in the end I dealt with them more intensively this way and did not just learn them mindlessly by heart. ", "answer": "Conclusion"}
{"text": " However  I think that you can not always act according to \"learned\"  but also act from the gut in a situation. ", "answer": "Conclusion"}
{"text": " In hindsight  I don't think there will be a \"right model solution\" for such a scenario. ", "answer": "Conclusion"}
{"text": " I am not one hundred percent satisfied  because although I thought I understood the contents well  I was able to apply them to the realistic situation rather moderately and had a hard time especially with the structuring and comprehensiveness. ", "answer": "Conclusion"}
{"text": " On the whole  I am satisfied with my result. ", "answer": "Conclusion"}
{"text": " After working through it  I can definitely say that performance measurement and assessment are not easy topics and should not be underestimated  especially on the job  because every child learns differently and acquires different skills at different times. ", "answer": "Conclusion"}
{"text": " Before one can structure educational diagnostics more precisely  one must define more precisely what it sets as its goal in the first place. ", "answer": "Action_Plan"}
{"text": " costs me a lot of time  I hope however for a good result and will look at me after receipt of the solutions still more exactly and make notes if necessary. ", "answer": "Action_Plan"}
{"text": " However  I have been able to learn some perspectives that will be useful in my future career or even in internships. ", "answer": "Action_Plan"}
{"text": " It would probably be useful to revisit this topic at a later date to deepen my knowledge. ", "answer": "Action_Plan"}
{"text": " And is something I will try to implement in the future. ", "answer": "Action_Plan"}
{"text": " Overall  I would rate my level of competence better than before the processing especially since I  as a future teacher  intend to adopt some of the presented strategies and methods in my lessons  e.g. regarding comprehension questions or a kind of quiz at the end of the lesson. ", "answer": "Action_Plan"}
{"text": " It is also difficult for me to decide how much I should write and whether I should possibly leave out a few points because it becomes too much. ", "answer": "Action_Plan"}
{"text": " In fact  in the end  it is important to apply the individual reference norm in order to be able to evaluate criterially at the end of a teaching unit in a class work. ", "answer": "Action_Plan"}
{"text": " If the results in a class assignment turn out as in the case study  the parents should look for possibilities together with the school to support the students as well as the teacher. ", "answer": "Action_Plan"}
{"text": " It would therefore make sense to redesign the performance survey that still exists in all schools  for which the analysis example offers many suggestions. ", "answer": "Action_Plan"}
