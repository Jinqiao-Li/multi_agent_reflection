{"text": " I judge my reflection as intensive I would rate the learning unit as well done. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " The active engagement with the subject matter using a practical example  promotes active engagement with the subject matter and makes the material of the lectures more tangible through a theoretical practical experience and sensitizes us students as future teachers to always reflect and question ourselves  so that the quality of teaching can be improved.

{"text": " In addition  active engagement helps to ensure that what is learned can be better processed and is not erased from the brain immediately after the exam. ", "answer": "0"}

{"text": " The subject area of pedagogical diagnostics is of central importance for a prospective teacher - but due to the complexity for me personally a real challenge. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " Therefore  I have already thought a lot about the subject area in advance  but was only partially satisfied with my findings. ", "answer": "1"}
{"text": " The written task was not easy for me overall  because due to the complexity of the subject area many aspects are to be considered and also from learning contents not everything was completely opened up to me  although I have completely worked through the video recordings of the VL  the basic seminar and the tutorial.

{"text": " The task was easy for me because I read through the corresponding slides beforehand. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " Furthermore  I created a corresponding overview for myself  so that I could derive different approaches and solutions from it. ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " I enjoyed working on this module because you got an insight into the later professional field and could deal with a realistic and challenging situation. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " I found the slides very informative and helpful in completing the assignment. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " I was able to take a lot from the learning module by working on the practical task reference. ", "answer": "4"}
{"text": " I am very interested in the topic  however  it has been very extensive. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " It took me a lot of time to go through and understand all the slides. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " Nevertheless  I found working on the task very exciting. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " Because such a scenario can happen to any teacher in their future professional life. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " By intensively dealing with the topic  I have a much greater understanding in the future. ", "answer": "5"}
{"text": " At the beginning  I had a little difficulty with the topic and had to read up longer. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " Especially because there were so many slides on it. ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " Overall  I found working on this assignment more difficult than working on the first assignment. ", "answer": "4"}
{"text": " I intensively studied this topic thanks to working on the task. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " It is a very complex subject and this elaboration of the situation makes it easier to understand. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " As with the last time I worked on the assignment  I think that by working intensively and doing research  one will have more in mind in the future than by just memorizing for the exam. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " When working on this topic  it requires close attention to detail  as I think it is a complex issue. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " With the help of a summary  which I made for myself and with the help of the associated seminar  in which this topic was examined in more detail  I was able to bring in a structure for myself. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " It always helps me to connect the learned theory with practice and to illustrate it with a possible case study. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " In my opinion  I did not find it as difficult as I would have expected to get started with the other materials. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " In my learning processes it helps me immensely at the beginning to have an overview of the extent of the topic I want to acquire. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " So I can better locate individual contents and link them to further information.aher ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " I found the overview that the proseminar provided by addressing several subfields very helpful. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " Also  that individual things such as \"self fulfilling prophecy\"  i.e. the assumptions and expectations of one person about another  have the tendency to prove themselves true by influencing behavior has already been covered in other lectures such as in elementary school pedagogy has helped my understanding. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " This allows me to focus on new topics that I am not yet familiar with. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " For a more detailed overview I went through the set of slides that I had already taken as a guide during the proseminar. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " In itself  I could not really connect anything with the terms Pedagogical Diagnostics at the very beginning  because I did not want to create any mis-connections. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " With such I often confuse myself  since I store both associations. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " Therefore  in a way  I wait to link the term until I find an \"official source\". ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " In other words a note from a teacher  or something fixed in the slide set  etc.... ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " So I also avoid remembering something vaguely  but then not being able to put it into words. ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " However  this way of connecting a topic concretely with the facts only when I have a reliable source (helpful for exams) makes it difficult for me sometimes to ask questions at the beginning of the topic. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " Since I have quasi still no opinion to the topic  since I connect it still with nothing. ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " To ask at the beginning for a clarification  or explanation to the facts connected with the topic would probably help me there. ", "answer": "4"}
{"text": " And is something I will try to implement in the future. ", "answer": "5"}
{"text": " To revisit the content and possibly get another explanation from a different angle  I still listen to the lecture notes following my review of the slide set. ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " So quasi have already heard of everything and made connections. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " Also  I usually notice areas that I need to look at more closely and review. ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " These are usually areas that don't intrinsically intersect with my interests  or that I haven't completely understood yet. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " Being able to absorb information poorly due to the form of the day is also sometimes a reason. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " The problem of interest can usually be solved by thinking around  especially in social and educational topics. ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " Because such content can be well linked with content of everyday life (unfortunately  because the topic of performance assessment and learning progress analysis in our home is unfortunately associated with negative experiences)  but also because it ishilfreich for interests such as story writing task on the topic of introduction to educational diagnostics. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " So I can increase my interest in a topic that in itself is quite extensive and not directly related to interests  so and motivate myself for it. ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " If there are still parts that have not stuck I have to repeat them again with the set of slides  possibly write them down again myself. ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " Here in this topic  for example  the classification of diagnostic instruments according to Leutner. ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " Since here the exact terms are necessary to be learned. ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " In general  I am never satisfied with my learning result  because I know how much more others can absorb  retain and  above all  put into words from the subject. ", "answer": "4"}
{"text": " But in a way I am satisfied  because I know that is what I have absorbed and  above all  understood in the time given to me. ", "answer": "4"}
{"text": " Without breaking myself by \"cramming\" until two in the morning. ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " So in conclusion ... trying to understand the subject  find interest in it and suspension points with which I can remember content easier. ", "answer": "4"}
{"text": " The written assignment was clearly stated  however I approached the assignment with rather mixed feelings as I did not know exactly what was required of me. ", "answer": "1"}
{"text": " In order to understand the topic  I took the set of slides by Prof. Dr. Gläser-Zikuda to hand  however  I found it rather unstructured or it did not help me personally much in understanding the diagnostics. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " After a certain time  however  it went. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " I don't think my submission went well because I also had a hard time understanding the subject  I still did it with my best conscience. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " Now  however  I have dealt with the subject more intensively and have definitely learned new things. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " Honestly  I was a bit unsure about the first question and I also don't know if that was required of me as well. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " So to structure the content better  I created a table. ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " This table has also helped me in understanding the content  because I had to think a few times and look up whether this can now be so true. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " I'm not completely satisfied with my result in the first task  because I also don't know if it's true that way. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " I could work on the second task more easily and I think my result in this task is good. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " I was very motivated. ", "answer": "1"}
{"text": " At first I thought that it was a rather uninteresting topic however I found the content very important and therefore also very interesting. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " Prepared I was not actually however I could by the available. Vorlesungsfolien me during the processing much extract. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " I find the tasks were very difficult  so that I did not know directly what to do at the beginning ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " It was fun for me to learn something new. ", "answer": "1"}
{"text": " I was not concentrated at the beginning so I left the learning sequence and resumed it a few days later. quite good. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " Actually  I find it quite relaxing  however  sometimes it can become very tiring to boot up the PC and start the exercise. ", "answer": "1"}
{"text": " I am now very familiar with the subject. ", "answer": "4"}

{"text": " A psychology lecture already provided me with some knowledge in the area of validity  judgment error  and objectivity. ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " Thanks to participation in the block seminar on school pedagogy at the beginning of the semester and a didactics lecture  I already possessed a small knowledge of the topic of feedback. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " So far I was inexperienced in the other areas of the subject Introduction to Pedagogical Diagnostics. ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " The script asked me the possibility to get to know these other areas and thus to cope with the previous work phase in the best possible way. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " The subject of Pedagogical Diagnostics is very interesting for me personally. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " Couldn't really look forward to it and motivate me at the moment though because of the online semester  as I don't feel like I can absorb much learning content. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " I only understood what exactly was required of me after reading through the question several times. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " I liked it to reproduce the  for me  rather unclear slides in their own wording. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " I could not concentrate so well during this  but this is due to the current situation. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " The written task became clearer and clearer during the processing. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " Independent learning does not suit me  as I lose my focus too quicklyI estimate my level of competence in this subject as satisfactory  as I have no real motivation for learning due to the online semester. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " I personally find my solution to the written assignments good. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " In my opinion  you could do without these three pages of reflection and shorten it to one detailed reflection. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " The learning unit would have turned out very pleasant if there was no online semester and I myself was more motivated. ", "answer": "4"}
{"text": " Before I worked on this assignment  I first just read through the slides of the lecture and already noticed that I didn't understand everything  because I still lacked the details to many key points to be able to understand them. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " Nevertheless  I looked at the task afterwards but quickly noticed  however  that I didn't really understand what I had to do. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " After the little food for thought  I then at least knew which slides I needed to work on the task and also realized how I should approach the task. ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " However  the individual key points on the slide were not enough for me to work on the task  which is why I then watched the lecture recording first to understand what it was all about. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " After that I was actually able to work on the task quite well. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " Since I had not yet dealt with the topic of pedagogical diagnostics before I did the assignment  I did not know at the beginning what to expect in terms of content here. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " While working on the task  however  it became clear to me what this is all about and also how important it is for my later profession. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " In retrospect  I would say that I learned a lot through this task and also understood what I should pay attention to later in my lessons. ", "answer": "4"}
{"text": " However  I don't know if I will be able to put this into practice because I am still completely lacking practice there. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " However  I find that this and also the task on class management and dealing with disturbances have prepared me the most for the real everyday life of a teacher in my teacher training program so far. ", "answer": "4"}
{"text": " Ms. Klammer is bad at changing the given guidelines of the tasks to be asked  but she is better at explaining the procedure and the related evaluation criteria to the students. ", "answer": "4"}
{"text": " In addition  with the help of feedback research  she could improve students' learning strategies and bring them additional motivation. ", "answer": "5"}
{"text": " This can also be very well linked to the self-tests mentioned above. ", "answer": "0"}

{"text": " I then started directly with the work phase to apply the learned content. ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " I find the learning content comprehensibly structured and easy to understand  which is why I find the topics very interesting. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " I already knew individual topics/words in the individual lectures from the Psychology 1 module  which also helped me to understand the topics in the lectures. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " The learning phase was good because both in the lecture and in the basic seminar the different dimensions of educational diagnostics were explained and presented in detail. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " However  I would have liked to see more practical examples. ", "answer": "4"}
{"text": " The whole topic  although on the whole well comprehensible  is very theoretical. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " I would have been very interested  for example  in children's solutions to the example tests presented. ", "answer": "4"}
{"text": " (Besides  there was a lot of text.) ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " I found the questions for self-control in the learning module of the basic seminar very good. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " This allowed me to check what I understood or to reread what I answered incorrectly. ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " I found the work assignment understandable and easy to do. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " I limited myself here to one aspect of educational diagnostics to answer the question. ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " I find it very good that the tasks are not about a knowledge query  but about understanding and transfer. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " I also appreciate the practical application character of the tasks! ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " At first the topic sounded very complicated and foreign  until I noticed that I already knew a lot from the last semester in educational psychology and could therefore at least roughly already get an idea. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " My first thoughts after reading the case study were: Ms. Klammer must know the performance level of more than just individual pupils  individual queries are not sufficient here. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " Why do many not participate in the lessons? ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " Motivation problems? ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " How can these possibly be remedied? ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " Did Ms. Klammer really overestimate her class so much that the result was so bad? ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " By already knowing a lot from educational psychology  one could easily cope with most of the slides. ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " But then the actual transfer and application to a practical situation turned out to be a bit more difficult  because one had such a wide range of possible reasons  models  approaches and methods at one's disposal. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " I am not one hundred percent satisfied  because although I thought I understood the contents well  I was able to apply them to the realistic situation rather moderately and had a hard time especially with the structuring and comprehensiveness. ", "answer": "4"}
{"text": " I had a lot of fun completing it at first  but the thought-provoking material takes or takes too much time to work out. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " As an alternative  I find uniform grids for such tasks more useful. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " I find educational diagnostics to be one of the most interesting topics in the \"SP\" course. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " I don't know how well you can ride by on a transfer task if you only get food for thought or further tasks to consider little by little. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " No  I wasn't always clear on the assignments. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " I think it's great to help the teacher with diagnostics because at least in \"corona\" time it gives you a chance to apply your knowledge and doesn't just require query. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " I worked on the task in stages and was accordingly \"freshly\" concentrated  in the process I unfortunately often lost the thread when I had to restart. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " I have already answered this question in another upload. ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " If you have a study group  you can help each other to explain incomprehensible things to each other. ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " But in this \"Corona\" time without presence - meaning not seeing fellow students is very hard to be on your own  especially as a Ersti. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " I have to read through this topic again and again because I have to prepare for other topics and courses  but I understood the core. ", "answer": "3"}
{"text": " I think my solution/result is good. ", "answer": "4"}
{"text": " I think I was able to address all the questions well and extensively. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " I rate my overall learning unit as satisfactory based solely on the individual reference standard. ", "answer": "4"}
{"text": " Reflection before the work phase: ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " Regrettably  I approached this task with somewhat less motivation than in the first written task  since the subject matter did not particularly appeal to me and I had to struggle with minor comprehension difficulties. ", "answer": "3"}

{"text": " the pedagogical diagnosticsTherefore ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " I took another look at the most important parts of the recorded/scored lecture. ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " On the whole  it was clear to me what I should do  however  I was not quite clear how to best implement it. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " Reflection during the work phase: ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " First  I took a closer look at all the lecture slides again and marked what seemed important to me. ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " After that  it was just a matter of putting the whole thing into a self-explanatory text  which turned out to be not so easy in some places. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " But all in all I got along well with the task. ", "answer": "4"}
{"text": " Reflection after the work phase:After working on the task  I definitely have the feeling that this task has given me the chance to gain a deeper understanding of pedagogical diagnostics and that I am now generally more familiar with the topic. ", "answer": "4"}
{"text": " Prior to working on the practice assignment  I made sure I had my materials on hand so that I could access them at appropriate points. ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " However  I found that I was able to navigate the topic \"Classroom Management\" better than the topic \"Educational Diagnostics. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " During the editing process  I was therefore not yet so sure about the assignment and therefore definitely needed the \"little food for thought\" and the \"little content tip.\" ", "answer": "4"}
{"text": " After the processing I would say that I have again dealt with the pedagogical diagnostics in more depth through the outlining and the case study. ", "answer": "4"}
{"text": " Before the learning unit I had a hard time to summarize the definitions and theoretical explanations of the topic. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " After I have gone through the documents again carefully I have found it easier. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " In general  I find the independent work on StudOn a bit difficult  because I can motivate myself alone without consultation rather sporadically. ", "answer": "4"}
{"text": " However  I found the practical second sub-task particularly fun  where you could come up with a concept for future lesson planning. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " All in all  I worked through the course unit thoroughly and understood the content. ", "answer": "4"}
{"text": " - Reflection on the situation before working through the subject matter: ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " Initially  I was excited about the task and willing to cope with it. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " Reflection on the situation during the processing of the topic: ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " I looked at the given tips and tried to find out what exactly was required of me. ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " In doing so  I was often unsure whether I had too much or too little depth in my answers.- ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " Reflection on the situation after dealing with the subject matter: ", "answer": "0"}
{"text": " I am relatively satisfied with my answers to the questions  even if a certain uncertainty remains as to whether the result is sufficient. ", "answer": "2"}
{"text": " Nevertheless  I think it is good that these two topics should be answered in writing and consequently are not relevant to the exam. ", "answer": "2"}
