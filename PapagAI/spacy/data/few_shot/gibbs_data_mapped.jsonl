{"text": "In the beginning  unfortunately  not so good  because unfortunately there were no lectures where the content of the slides was explained to you again in other words.", "answer": "Analysis"}
{"text": "The practical reference with the case study  because you could think yourself so well in a perhaps later in professional life real situation and could think for yourself how you would deal with it or should deal with it.", "answer": "Analysis"}
